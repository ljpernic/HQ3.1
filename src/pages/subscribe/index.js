              Each ad appears on every page of the website, and the square ads change position with each pageview. Do note, however, that all advertisements are subject to approval.

            <p>
              To advertise, contact us using the contact form on our <Link to="/about">about page</Link>. Please also be prepared to send us a suitable image of 250 x 250 pixels 
              (for square ads) or 424 x 60 pixels (for the banner ad), along with a single link to whatever's being advertised.
