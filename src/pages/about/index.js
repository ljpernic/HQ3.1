                </h1>
                <p>
                  <i><b>Haven Spec</b></i> is a speculative fiction magazine featuring stories for a 21st century audience. We love stories with a 
                  sense of adventure, stories that teach us, that touch us, that leave us wanting more. We publish six issues every year, two of which (the DRY Issue and the 
                  WET Issue) are focused exclusively on the climate crisis and themes of displacement (very broadly defined).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The crisis facing our planet is immediate and all-encompassing, and it will affect people of color, people living in poverty, and the working classes most of
                  all. The popular metaphor is going over a cliff, but we prefer the tempest, the torrent, the flood. The waters are rising, but we can save ourselves.
