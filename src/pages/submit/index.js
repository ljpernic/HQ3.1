              Haven Spec Magazine is currently <strong>open</strong> to fiction and poetry submissions. We remain closed to art and non-fiction.  
              </p>
            <p>
              It's our goal to publish diverse voices from around the world, and to do that, we are actively seeking stories, poems, and 
              non-fiction pieces by authors from backgrounds that have been historically underrepresented in the science fiction and fantasy 
              canon. Our submission cycle is therefore split into two categories, where every other month is explicitly reserved for 
              submissions by authors of color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, and other underrepresented groups. The interposing six 
              months remain open to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
              As writers ourselves, we do our best to handle each submission with the care and attention it deserves. Every submission is an 
              act of bravery, and we know that putting yourself out there as a writer can be tough. Just know that any submission we receive, 
              unless it contains something illegal, will be kept in confidence.
            </p>
            <p>
                When in doubt, don't self reject! Submit submit submit!

            <p>
              We are testing out our new submission system (the Acolyte Submission System), and there will undoubtedly still be bugs to 
              work out. <strong>So, when you submit, please keep the following in mind</strong>:

            <div className='submitGuidelines'>
              <ul>
                <li>Your submission may take several seconds to go through.</li>
                <li>You can only submit one story at a time, but if we pass on it, feel free to submit again without waiting. </li>
                <li>You can only submit five poems at a time, and they should all be in a single file. </li>
                <li>You will get an email confirming your submission. If, after an hour or two, you haven't gotten confirmation (and 
                  you've checked your spam folder), you should feel free to submit the same piece again. Just indicate in the cover 
                  letter that it is a do-over. This will also help troubleshoot any lingering problems in the code.

              Guidelines for Fiction
                    </h3>
            <p>
              We like stories that are subtle in their telling and stick with us long after we've finished, and we're more likely to 
              buy stories that balance a sense of wonder with a bold plot and emotional depth. For our two issues focused on the climate 
              crisis, we're particularly interested in publishing stories from people displaced by or threatened by the climate emergency 
              (see our themes below). For our other four issues, we're open to a wide variety of stories across the SFF and weird spectra.
            </p>
            <div className='submitGuidelines'>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay:</strong> 8Â¢ per word for original fiction</li>
                <li><strong>Word limit:</strong> 6000 words</li>
                <li><strong>Language:</strong> English</li>
                <li><strong>Rights:</strong> We buy first serial print and electronic rights for publication of the story in the English 
                  language and throughout the world. We also buy non-exclusive archival rights for our website and non-exclusive anthology 
                  rights.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
              We welcome writers from around the world who are writing in the English language, and we're open to translations as 
              long as the piece hasn't appeared in English before. While we've accepted a few reprints in the past, we are currently 
              only looking for original, previously unpublished fiction. Simultaneous submissions are fine, but please no multiple 
              submissions. We also ask that you use the Shunn manuscript format and either .rtf, .doc, or .docx file types. 
            </p>
            <p>
              We try to respond to all submissions within ten weeks, so feel free to query by replying to your confirmation email if it has been 
              longer than that. We also fully admit that sometimes it takes much longer, so we apologize in advance. If we hold a piece, please 
              wait until you get our final decision to submit again. And if we publish your piece, we ask that you wait six months from the date 
              of publication before you submit again. Finally, while we do publish both flash fiction and stories close to our word limit, our 
              sweet spot is between 1000 and 4000 words.

            <p>
              We like poems that use complex fixed verse forms (think sestina, awdl gywydd, masnavi, etc), but we're not against blank or 
              free verse. Most important to us is vivid imagery, clever lyricism, and a strong emotional core. For our two issues focused

              climate emergency (see our themes below). For our other four issues, we're open to a wide variety of poems across the SFF

              example, if I wanted to make a reference to <a href='https://www.havenspec.com/the-hundred-loves'>one of the many
