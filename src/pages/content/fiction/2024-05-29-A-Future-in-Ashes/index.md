Cass can\'t bring herself to watch her brother burn. All the websites
say you should, and that you should also watch as they scrape the ash up
and put it in the urn. That you should not take your eyes off your loved
one at all.

She doesn\'t understand how anyone could follow that advice.

She stays in the waiting area, sitting in one of the hard plastic
chairs. There is a bereavement room with a couch and a small table where
people can sit and weep in something closer to comfort, but to Cass it
feels too small and... full. Full of sadness and confusion and the ache
of stale loneliness. Her grief needs more space. Her grief is bigger
than a small room already crowded with painful echoes.
