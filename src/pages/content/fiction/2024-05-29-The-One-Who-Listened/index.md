There is a language that I know, but my tongue cannot form the words.
Even if it could, the sentences are too long for you to listen to. They
stretch across hours, or days. You are like the small fast ones of the
forest—the birds, the lightning sparks of minnows in the
creeks—words pour off your tongue, your hands flutter in the air. I
can move quickly, too, but language is meant to be slow.

You were trying to save me, I know. But it is very lonely here.
