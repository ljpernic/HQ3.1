<strong>The Book of Genesis</strong><br /><strong>Chapter 7: And They Were Witches.</strong>

<sup>1</sup>Two by two... of the clean animals and the unclean, of the birds, and
of everything that crawls, male and female, they all came to Noah, into
the ark, just as God had commanded. <sup>2</sup>Then the rains poured down. And
the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and floodgates of the skies
were flung open.

<sup>3</sup>Noah, a steadfast and faithful servant of God, manned the ark and
oversaw the boarding of all creatures great and small. <sup>4</sup>Noah and his
sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth, were the only men aboard the ark... but we
know they were not the only people.

<sup>5</sup>Gloria, Noah's wife, and their daughters-in-law, Tanisha and Maeeda,
were also aboard the ark. And they were witches. <sup>6</sup>The rains had fallen
for ten days already, long enough to have wiped out a quarter of the
earth's population. The rains would fall for thirty more.

<sup>7</sup>The three witches had one duty. To thwart the flood.

<sup>8</sup>Tanisha flew in through the ark's window, shifting from a raven, back
to her human form. Then she ran down to the ark's bunker where Gloria
and Maeeda waited.

"Tell us, what befalls those out there?" Gloria squeezed her hands with
nerved anticipation.

"The flatlands are gone." Tanisha shook off the water in her hair, the
wet down feathers on her arms and legs slowly disappearing into her
skin. "People have fled up the mountains, but soon, they too will
perish."

<sup>9</sup>The raging flood crashing and thrashing against the ark confirmed
Tanisha's testimony. For ten days, the rains had pelted on the roof
above. It was the sound of falling rocks. <sup>10</sup>Gathered in a circle, the
witches struggled to find balance as the ark rose and fell in the waves.

"We must act quickly," Gloria inhaled, looking to her daughters-in-law.
Her daughters-in-law looked to her.

<sup>11</sup>Though Noah's immediate family was safe: his wife, his sons, and his
daughters-in-law, there were those on the ark whose families perished
outside the ark. Gloria had eleven siblings, three aged parents, and an
old family cat. None were aboard the ark. Maeeda came from a large
kindred, of cousins, aunts, nephews, and nieces, stretching from Babel
to the gates of Eden. <sup>12</sup>None were aboard the ark.

<sup>13</sup>Before the flood began, Gloria had sent a raven to her siblings, and
they had sent one back. <em>We depart for the ark</em>, their parchment had
read. But as they had hastened towards the ark, God sealed the doors
shut. <sup>14</sup>From Tanisha's scoutings, she had spotted Gloria's siblings
high up on Mount Kilimanjaro. They were battered and ill, but they were
safe. Not for long.

"We must choose for the sacrifice." Gloria pulled out a sack from
underneath her woolen garments. The sack held four stones, each engraved
with the names of her husband and her sons. One for Noah. One for Shem.
One for Ham. One for Japheth.

"We need not choose. I willingly volunteer my husband, Ham, as tribute."
Tanisha patriotically stepped forward, straightening her robe. "The hour
is nigh. Let us go kill him." The young witch drew her blade, a smile
flooding her face, wickedness brewing in her big doe eyes.

"Tanisha, please." Maeeda rubbed her forehead. Tanisha's propensity for
wanton murder was getting a bit exhausting.

"Tanisha, the sacrifice demands we pick at random," Gloria reminded her.

"Right." A disappointed Tanisha sheathed her blade. Disappointed, but
not defeated. Her time would come.

<sup>15</sup>And so Gloria shook the bag, and the women drew stones. <sup>16</sup>Out came
Shem, then Noah, then Ham. And last of all, the sacrificial choice,
Japheth.

"Nine hells!" It was Tanisha. She had hoped it would be Ham.

"Perhaps—perhaps we could pick again." Maeeda turned sympathetically
to Gloria. "We—we know Japheth is your most beloved child."

"No." Gloria heaved. It was a struggle. "Japheth is a virgin. The
potency of the sacrifice will be irreproachable. He is perfect."

"Still, as a mother, this must be painful for—"

"Oh, shut up, Maeeda!" Tanisha rolled her big eyes. "You're only saying
this because you fancy Japheth and were looking forward to adultering
with him."

"Tanisha!" Maeeda rushed for her.

"I wonder what your precious Shem would think about that." Tanisha
backed away from Maeeda's reach. "And can we stop pretending we like our
husbands. I know you both enjoy having me be the psycho
husband-murdering witch, which I am fine with, but your
self-righteousness is becoming tedious," Tanisha drew out the words, her
glare fixed on Maeeda.

"We have a world-ending ego-fueled catastrophe to avert." Gloria
painfully massaged her temples, her patience tried and tested. The
babbling baboons high up in the ark beams were contributing
significantly to the migraine that had ailed her for the past ten days.
"Comport yourselves!"

<sup>17</sup>And the younger witches comported themselves. They began erecting an
altar, for the sacrifice. They had built a lot of altars in the past, so
this was light work. <sup>18</sup>They were always building altars. They built an
altar whenever God was moody. They built an altar when Noah caught an
STD after getting into a threesome with the innkeeper and his wife. They
built an altar whenever an owl hooted thrice in a row—which was all
the time.

<sup>19</sup>The two barn owls aboard the ark were thankfully not the hooting
type. They followed the witches everywhere, and now they watched them
build the altar.

"Isaac must have been distraught watching his father, Abraham, build an
altar with plans of sacrificing him on it." Maeeda looked up at the
ever-watching owls. Her eyes briefly flashed white, her pupils gone.

"Who?" Tanisha raised an angry brow, an altar stone in her hand.

"Abraham?"

"Who in Jehovah's name is Abraham?"

"Noah's ancestor..." Maeeda thought about it for a minute, the creases
on her forehead deepening. "... or was it his descendant?"

"Are you seeing into the future again?" Tanisha snapped her fingers in
Maeeda's face, snapping her out of it. "Get that under control before
you plunge us into a prophetical disaster. The one we are in is bad
enough!"

<sup>20</sup>And stone by stone, brick by brick, they completed the altar.
<sup>21</sup>And instead of fire and wood, they cast water onto the stones.

"Are you certain about this?" Maeeda came to stand next to Gloria, as
Tanisha emptied pails of water on the stones.

"It is what the sacrifice demands."

<sup>22</sup>After flooding the altar with water, it was time for the sacrificial
lamb. Japheth.
<br /><br />

**Chapter 7: The Two Who Wrestled in The Hay.**

<sup>23</sup>Japheth was the youngest son of Gloria and Noah. He was also their
only unmarried child. <sup>24</sup>Two days after boarding the ark, while Japheth
raked away bison shit, he had found a stowaway hiding in the hay. Their
name was Sata. Japheth had run to beckon his father and brothers.
<sup>25</sup>But Sata tackled him to the ground. A fierce struggle ensued, the
braying bellows of the bisons drowning out the fight. Japheth's fist
found Sata's jaw. Sata's elbow struck Japheth's nose. Japheth's hands
squeezed tight around Sata's neck. Sata's tongue down Japheth's throat.
<sup>26</sup>Japheth's penis in Sata's mouth.

<sup>27</sup>Young Japheth had been a virgin up until that point. But this
encounter with Sata, it shifted something in him. It was in the way Sata
touched him, like he was communion bread, like his lips were grape wine,
and Sata was thirsty. It was in the way Sata held him, like he was
scripture. <sup>28</sup>Sata touched him, and young Japheth was born again.

<sup>29</sup>And Sata was beautiful. The most beautiful girl. The most beautiful
boy. Japheth was not sure. <sup>30</sup>Sometimes, Sata was a tall,
slender-muscled lad. Sometimes, Sata was a freckled girl with wandering
eyes, and braids reaching for the ark floor. Sometimes, they were a
giant. Sometimes, they had horns. Sometimes, they had a broken halo.
<sup>31</sup>But Japheth was certain of one thing; there was none more divine
than Sata. <sup>32</sup>Sata's eyes were stars in rivers of glass. Their body was
bamboo, the way it bent, the way it swayed. Their skin was fleece
dimpling under Japheth's fingers. And their hair was brown brown bark,
it was white white clouds. <sup>33</sup>Sometimes, Japheth wondered if he would
ever be as beautiful.

"Beauty is many things," Sata kissed his collarbone.

"You must stop reading my mind."

"I am not," Sata smiled, squeezing their small naked body further into
Japheth's own naked body, like a bird settling into its nest. <sup>34</sup>Bodies
drawn in sweat and heat, chests rising and falling, they had just
finished two bouts of acrobatic lovemaking. <sup>35</sup>Against Japheth's rough
chestnut skin, Sata's was an oiled night. It was darkness finding light.
It was black fire. <sup>36</sup>Japheth traced his hand from their shoulder, down
to their waist, to their thighs.

"That—that thing you did with your tongue, I thought my heart would
explode."

Sata giggled. "You did explode."

<sup>37</sup>A shyness found Japheth's cheeks, and he looked away. <sup>38</sup>And Sata
became an enormous man, towering over Japheth, pulling him closer.
Japheth was the small one now. <sup>39</sup>He liked being the small one
sometimes, being tugged at like he weighed a feather, being pulled. None
of the girls he had kissed before the flood had been able to pull him
this way.

"Where did you learn all this?"

"To shift?"

"Oh—oh no." Japheth had never thought to ask why the person he'd been
bedding for the past eight days sometimes grew horns. The bisons forced
to watch their intense carnalities probably had thoughts. "The way that
you love."

"I had a lover once." A sadness rolled into Sata's voice. "He taught me
many things, and I taught him many things."

"Who is this lover?"

"He is a king."

"Of which kingdom?"

"Many kingdoms." Sata pulled away, hugging themself. "It is from him I
hide in your ark."

Japheth saw it in the way Sata's body withdrew. They were still a big
hulking man, but they were also small, fear finding all the corners of
their being.

"Tell me." Japheth held Sata. "What happened?"

"I became too beautiful."

"Oh."

"Beauty is many things. Sometimes it is pain."

Japheth kissed Sata's forehead. "He will perish in this flood and will
never bring you pain again. I promise."

"I believe you, young Japheth... but only for today."

<sup>40</sup>They usually did not get to lie around and hold each other, to savor
each other's bodies like milk and sugarcane. <sup>41</sup>The ark, three hundred
cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high, had too much
work waiting. The animals had to be fed and contained from butchering
each other. The cypress wood had to constantly be coated in pitch, to
keep the waters from leaking in. There were holes that needed patching,
cows that needed milking, and shit that needed raking. <sup>42</sup>Shem was
already on his neck for slinking off at odd hours, but this time,
Japheth did not care. This time, he did not yank on his pants and dash
off. <sup>43</sup>This time, Japheth stayed.

"Japheth!"

The sound of his name jolted him awake.

"Someone is coming." Sata moused away, further into the haystack.

"Japheth!" His name came again. It was not his father. It was not Shem
or Ham.

"Mother." Japheth crawled out from under the bison enclosure to meet
Gloria. "I was just cleaning out the pens. Did you need me for
something?"

"Oh, my boy," Gloria's hand went to his cheek, down to his shoulders.
"I've looked everywhere for you." Her eyes were glassy and moist.

"Are you well, mama?"

Japheth did not know his mother to be overly affectionate. She was
adequate and practical, and her love was not boundless.

"Yes, yes." Gloria took back her hand. "I just needed help moving
some\... furniture...in the bunker."

"Okay\..." Japheth wasn't sure he had ever seen any furniture in the
bunker. "I'll come once I'm done here."
<br /><br />

**Chapter 7: The Sacrifice.**

<sup>44</sup>Japheth walked into the bunker and the witches jumped him. Tanisha
and Maeeda bound his limbs in ropes and gagged his mouth before dragging
him to the altar. <sup>45</sup>Japheth fought, and Japheth tore, but it was
useless against unyielding catastrophe-averting witches. <sup>46</sup>The apes
swinging in the beams above howled and chattered, heralding his capture,
and imminent slaughter. <sup>47</sup>Japheth managed to wiggle out of the gag,
and then he screamed, but the raging storm outside drowned his screams.
The witches threw him onto the watery altar.

"Is—is this an altar?" A bound Japheth twisted and turned to confirm
if he'd been dropped on an altar. "Are you—are you going to sacrifice
me?"

"Yes." Tanisha did not mince words.

<sup>48</sup>Gloria and Maeeda promptly began to draw runes and enchantments on
the bunker grounds, spiraling the white chalk around the altar.

"What—why?!"

"We are going to stop the flood."

Japheth paused. "Stop—stop the flood? What does that even mean? Why
would you want to do that? How are you going to do that?" he blurted all
at once.

"You selfish little cunt," Tanisha yanked his hair back to look into his
face. "Your father, mother, and brothers might be in here; ours are out
there!" She let go of him with a shove. "And as to how we intend to stop
the flood, well, surprise, surprise, we're witches," Tanisha smirked a
witchy smirk.

Japheth blinked twice. "Oh."

<sup>49</sup>Tanisha's smirking faded in the face of Japheth's lack of reverence.
The young man had been getting hot and heavy with some random smoking
hot shapeshifting being. Witchcraft sounded stale in comparison.

"We—we are witches, so, so, we have powers and magic and stuff,"
Tanisha tried to explain but looked pathetic in the process.

"Right." Japheth pursed his lips. "Magic and stuff. Neither of which
will be enough considering you're going up against God!"

"Well, once we sacrifice you to Thor, we'll have another god on our
side." Tanisha's witchy smirk resurfaced.

"Who is Thor?"

"I don't know, some god from another myth your mother found," Tanisha
shrugged.

"You are going to sacrifice me to a god who might be myth?" The question
came as a whisper, as realization dawned on him. Japheth screamed.
"Mother! Mama! Do not let them do this to me!"

"You realize your mummy is our supreme witch leader, right?" Tanisha
cocked her head, her hands on her waist.

<sup>50</sup>Done with the runes and enchantments, Gloria and Maeeda joined them
at the altar.

"Let us be done with it," Gloria said as they circled Japheth.

"Mother, please! Please do not do this!"

"Thor Odinson, God of thunder and rain, of lightning, storms, and sacred
groves! Heed our call!"

"Heed our call!" Maeeda and Tanisha intoned.

"It's me! It's Japheth! It's your boy! Mother!"

"Lend us your strength that we might hold back the fountains and save
our world!"

"Heed our call!"

"Mama, please!"

"Thor Odinson, we offer you—"

<sup>51</sup>Tanisha hijacked the ritual. "We offer you the juiciest of boys
because we heard a rumor you have a twink boy fetish!" she rushed it all
out in one breath.

"Wait, really?" Maeeda struggled to hide her fascination.

"What. Is. Wrong. With. You?!" Gloria punctuated every word.

"Well, it is true," Tanisha scrunched her shoulders, quite satisfied
with herself.

"I am not a twink," Japheth muttered under his breath.

"What did you say?" Tanisha looked down at him.

"I said I am not a twink!" Japheth announced a little louder."Well,
forgive me for not brushing up on my gay lingo before breakfast,"
Tanisha sighed the biggest sigh. "And nobody cares! Compared to a god,
you are an eternal twink, twink!" She brought her face up close to his,
making sure he heard her loud and clear.

<sup>52</sup>Gloria looked up to the ark\'s roof, lost in thought as the
bickering carried on.

"Enough!" She slammed her hands on the altar, and everyone stopped
squabbling, and silence fell in the circle. "Give me the fucking knife
Tanisha!" She seethed through angry teeth.

Tanisha curtsied like a drama major, offering her the knife.
Japheth's terrified eyes followed the blade.

"Mother—"

"We offer this sacrifice in bits and pieces."

"What?!"

<sup>53</sup>Gloria ignored him and pulled at his ear, the blade's cold metal
finding the soft cartilage of his ear.

"Wait, wait, wait!" Japheth was breathless.

Tanisha groaned with boredom. "Can we chop him to pieces already!"

"Please cut my other ear first. This is my good side. I cannot bear to
die ugly." Japheth's body wracked with sobs.

<sup>54</sup>The three women stared down at him, quite taken aback by the
request. Wordlessly, Maeeda turned his head to the other ear. <sup>55</sup>Gloria
and Tanisha were looking at her.

"We might as well," Maeeda said, pity in her eyes. "And for what it's
worth Japheth, I don't think you're ugly."

The young man sniffled. "Thank you."

<sup>56</sup>Gloria chopped off his ear, and Japheth screamed a shrill, earless
scream.

"Thor Odinson! In your name, we seal his blood to this altar."

"Do his balls next!" Tanisha rubbed her palms in anticipation.

"Tanisha, I swear to God, when I get out of these ropes, you'll be the
first I kill!" Japheth spat at her, blood streaking down his face, into
his eyes, into his nostrils, into his mouth. Japheth was beautiful.

"Maybe in your next life!" Tanisha cackled, yanking down his pants as
Japheth burst into heart-rending tears.

"I have come for young Japheth."

<sup>57</sup>The three witches swung around to the origin of the voice. It was
Sata. They stepped into the foray. <sup>58</sup>They were naked.

"Who are you supposed to be? Adam?" Tanisha pulled out another blade and
pointed it at Sata's nakedness. She had many blades.

"Identify yourself!" Gloria echoed. "How did you get on this ark?"

"Japheth is my boyfriend."

"They are my friend."

<sup>59</sup>Sata and Japheth both said at once. <sup>60</sup>And for a moment, all the
animals ceased their chattering, and the storms stopped raging, just
'cause of the awkwardness in the room.

"Oh." Maeeda cupped her mouth. "Dramaaa."

"I'm sorry, I thought..." Sata's shoulders visibly dropped.

"We never labeled it, but I would like—" Japheth tried to salvage the
situation.

"Never labeled it?" Sata was riled up. Japheth had never seen them riled
up. "What about the fact that we've had intercourse twenty-five times in
the last eight days! Label that!"

<sup>61</sup>Tanisha and Maeeda gasped in unison.

"Oh, honey, you were counting it?" Maeeda was genuinely disheartened on
Sata's behalf.

"I've slept with a lot of people without labeling it." Japheth was
fighting back.

"Really?" It was Tanisha, the most mocking, most sarcastic chuckle
escaping her lips. "With whom? Kissing does not count."

"You don't know them Tanisha, they were from another village!"

"Sure, jerkmaster." <sup>62</sup>Tanisha let the laughter ring out from her
unrestrained. It poured out in the most chaotic bouts, shaking her, her
knees quaking to the ground. She tried to grab Maeeda for support, but
the other witch stepped aside, letting Tanisha fall, her guffawing
continuing as she sprawled out on the ark floor.

"This is an awful way to treat someone who likes you and is risking
their life for yours." Maeeda looked down at Japheth, disappointment
finding her eyes. "I always thought you different and more emotionally
mature than your brothers. I guess I thought wrong."

<sup>63</sup>Japheth, still tightly bound, blood trickling down the open gash on
his head, looked up at Maeeda, guilt building in his eyes.

"I'm—I'm sorry." Japheth spun in Sata's direction. "I don't know why I
said that. I was scared and afraid, and maybe it's because my mother and
sisters-in-law are trying to murder me, so I panicked. I like you. I
like you a lot. I like the way you stretch when you wake up. I like that
you sometimes have horns, and other times you have a halo—"

"They have what?" Gloria cut in.

Japheth carried on. "I like the sweetness of your voice. I like the
sparkle in your eyes. I like you, and I want to be your boyfriend."

<sup>64</sup>Their eyes were locked on each other. Sata smiled the brightest
smile.

"Great!" Tanisha dragged herself up from the ark floor, her laughing
spree coming to an end. "We're about to be the homophobic witches who
murdered the only gay people in this story."

"Oh God!" Maeeda hushed everyone. "If he is no longer a virgin, would
Thor be angry we lied about that and strike us down? Is the sacrifice
ruined?" She turned to Gloria for answers.

At this point, an exhausted Gloria went to sit on a pavement in the
corner, her face bowed in utter resignation. "He—he didn't need to be
a virgin. I made that up."

"And they say I'm messy." Tanisha let her excitement brim.

<sup>65</sup>Maeeda's eyes flashed white. "And you spelled the sack to ensure
Japheth was picked for the sacrifice."

Gloria's breath stiffened. "How—how do you know that?"

"I just saw it in the future."

"Perhaps try seeing more relevant things, you know, like a way to stop
this flood," Tanisha gestured around to their current predicament.

"I cannot control its direction."

"Right. Right." Tanisha threw up her hands and steered the conversation
back to Gloria. "So, you just wanted to murder Japheth? I thought he was
your most beloved son?"

<sup>66</sup>Gloria swallowed. "Japheth is unmarried. And I know we do not
particularly like our spouses, but if our plan fails and the flood
prevails, we would be the last people on earth, and then you'd be glad
you still have husbands."

Tanisha walked up to Gloria and gently took her hands. "I'm going to
hold your hand while saying this because I understand you're a boomer,
but you need to try decentering men."

"I agree." Maeeda nodded. And Gloria threw her the most judgmental look
ever recorded in biblical history.

"I aGreE," Gloria stood, mimicking her with vim and mockery, but mostly
vim. "Were you decentering men when you slept with my husband?"

Tanisha cupped a scream. "You slept with Noah? But he's old and
decrepit!"

"I—I—" Words failed Maeeda. She covered her face in embarrassment.

Tanisha put one arm over Maeeda's shoulder, and the other over Gloria's.

"Look at us, hm, united, messy, murderous women." Tanisha was enjoying
not being the sole black sheep.

<sup>67</sup>Then they heard running. <sup>68</sup>Japheth was no longer on the altar. He
was slung over Sata's shoulder, and they were headed for the bunker
door.

"Give him back!" The three witches stretched forth their hands, pulling
Japheth's body back onto the altar.

<sup>69</sup>And Sata roared into some creature of myth. <sup>70</sup>Their head was of a
dragon. Their limbs were of ice and mountain rocks. Their body was a
thunderstorm. And from their mouth poured forth coloured fire. And the
fire befell the witches, and with all their might, the witches quenched
the flames.

They battled for one thousand years. Not literally, it was just a
drawn-out battle.

"We will battle forever, for I will not let you slay him!" Sata
thundered.

"We will not hand him over!" Gloria thundered back. "I must slay him to
save many. Do you know what that does to a mother? You have known him
for a few fleeting moments, but I screamed him into this world!"

"And you will scream no more."

<sup>71</sup>Sata bit their finger, drawing blood. <sup>72</sup>Then they rushed past the
witches, and the women held them back. <sup>73</sup>But Sata needed only touch
the bloody gash on Japheth's head, and they did. And their blood met
Japheth's, altering their boyfriend's blood to demon blood, making him
unfit for the sacrifice.

"What have you done!" Gloria crumbled to the ground. "You have doomed us
all."

<sup>74</sup>And Gloria cried. The weight of their task had burdened her for
days, and she had failed. She wanted to be done with it all. <sup>75</sup>She
wanted to go home to her eleven siblings in Zimbabwe, drink hot cocoa,
and jump in the Masaii Lake. <sup>76</sup>And Gloria cried, and she cried, and
Maeeda held her hand.

"We will find another way." The younger woman squeezed the older woman's
hand in reassurance.

<sup>77</sup>Gloria smiled a weak but rising smile. <sup>78</sup>She turned to hold
Tanisha's hand. Tanisha was gone.

"Where is that foolish girl!"

<sup>79</sup>Like she'd heard Gloria, Tanisha burst back into the bunker holding
a head in her hands. <sup>80</sup>It was Ham. Her husband. <sup>81</sup>She skipped up to
the altar and shoved Japheth off the stones.

"Won't be needing you anymore," she declared as Japheth's body rolled
over. Sata ran over and began to untie their boyfriend.

Tanisha placed her husband's chopped-off bloodied head on the altar.

"Tanisha, what is this?" Gloria didn't even pretend to be shocked.

"The powerful gay sprite wasn't going to let us murder Japheth. We'd
have been at it for centuries. So I brought an alternative." She
gestured to the head. "You're welcome."

"Tanisha, the altar has already tasted Japheth's blood. We can't just
replace him. You know this!"

"I'm sure Thor would not mind. Ham and Japheth are technically the same
blood group or whatever. I murdered my husband for the sake of the
world!"

"Tanisha what the hell!" It was Ham's head.

<sup>82</sup>The three witches screamed and scattered back.

"Tanisha." Gloria calmed her heaving chest. "Why is your husband's
severed head speaking?"

Tanisha slowly turned to her mother-in-law. "We are both witnessing this
in real-time, at the same time, for the first time. My knowledge of
Ham's talking head is the same as yours."

"Why did you kill me, Tanisha?" Ham continued. "I thought you liked me?"

"Ew, no," Tanisha recoiled. "I only married you to get a visa to get
aboard the Ark."

"But I've been nothing but good to you. Why didn't you chop off my
father's head, or Shem's head?"

<sup>83</sup>Tanisha thought about it for a minute. "Well, upon reflection, those
options were available, and... you've not done anything remotely awful
to me. Wait... am I just an evil bitch?" Tanisha beamed, excited at her
self-journey and self-discovery.

"Well, fuck you, Tanisha!" Ham's head was as bitter as a severed head
could be.

"Fuck you too, Ham!"

"No, fuck you!"

"Fuck you!"

"Fuck—"

"Enough!" Gloria silenced them. "We had a flood to stop, and we failed.
We are just three witches with no power to avert what is to come."

"Well, four." Sata joined them. "There's four witches now."

Gloria weighed Sata's words and aid.

"Still, we cannot stand against God and live. The risk is too great.
Without the sacrifice, without another god, we are doomed."

<sup>84</sup>Sata walked to Gloria, coming face to face with the old woman. "You
are witches born of the damned, the cruel, the vengeful. You will hold
back rain."
<br /><br />

**Chapter 8: A Series of Unfortunate Events.**

<sup>1</sup>And so the four witches banded around the altar, Ham's head still on
the stones. They did not need it, but no one had cared to remove it.
<sup>2</sup>Together, the witches crafted a spell, one that did not require a
god, and with this spell, they held back rain. And the fountains of the
great abyss burst forth no longer, and the floodgates of the skies
sealed shut.

<sup>3</sup>And in prompt retaliation, a sea of blood flooded the bunker,
drowning the witches.

"What is happening!" Tanisha screamed, struggling to keep her head above
the blood.

"God is fighting back with the plagues of Egypt!" Maeeda answered.

"What the hell are the plagues of Egypt!"

"Oh, my bad, it's something from the future!"

<sup>4</sup>Tanisha rolled her eyes as a tidal wave of blood crashed into her.
<sup>5</sup>The witches strained, finding each other, fighting back, and turning
the blood into wine. Then, they drank it all up.

<sup>6</sup>So God sent frogs. Thousands of frogs descended upon them. And the
witches had frog legs for dinner.

<sup>7</sup>So God sent lice. And the witches shaved their hair.

<sup>8</sup>So God sent flies. And Maeeda went into the future and returned with
the most potent insecticide she could find, and they sprayed the flies
to death.

<sup>9</sup>So God killed all the livestock, which was weird because they didn't
have that many to begin with. So, that particular plague didn't do much.

<sup>10</sup>So God sent the boils. Dr Pimple Popper helped with that.

<sup>11</sup>So God sent hail. Kind of laughable considering the witches had
already discovered how to hold back rain and, in addition, hail.

<sup>12</sup>So God sent locusts. Insecticide, once again.

<sup>13</sup>So God sent darkness. Sending darkness upon witches, bred, and born
in darkness, now that was ridiculous.

<sup>14</sup>So God killed all the firstborn sons, but the witches were not men.

<sup>15</sup>In the six hundredth year of Gloria's life, on the twenty-seventh
day of the second month—on that day Gloria, Tanisha, Maeeda, and Sata
averted the great flood, weathered the ten plagues, and saved a fifth of
earth's population from genocide. <sup>16</sup>And the waters receded from the
earth until there was dry ground. <sup>17</sup>The ark came to rest upon the
mountains of Ararat. <sup>18</sup>And the witches rejoiced, hugging each other.

"What a quaint set-up you have here."

<sup>19</sup>Everyone turned around to the voice. It was some random middle-aged
mostly-caucasian man in a suit.

"Does this ark not have a bolt or something?" Tanisha unsheathed another
blade. "People just keep waltzing in!"

"Who are you, sir?" Gloria stepped forward.

"I am that I am." The man loomed mighty over them as trumpets and hymn
songs blasted out around Him. "Lily of the valley. King of Kings. Lord
of Lords. Lion of the Tribe of Judah."

<sup>20</sup>They all stared blankly at Him.

"I am God, but you can call me Chris." God pointed to the pink name tag
on His jacket, the name Chris scribbled in ugly, near-unreadable
handwriting.

"Chris?" Tanisha scoffed. "That's the whitest name ever."

"My mother gave me that name."

"Was your mother white?"

"What—what does that have to do with anything?"

"Deflection as a coping mechanism. Interesting." Taniaha said,
scribbling intensely with a feather pen, onto a piece of parchment.

<sup>21</sup>God leaned forward, trying to glimpse whatever she was jotting down.
"What are you—" God shook His head, snapping out of it. "Enough, you
weird girl! How did you stop my flood?"

"Witchcraft," Maeeda answered straight up.

"Three witches are not powerful enough to avert my might."

"Four, actually."

"Four?"

<sup>22</sup>Gloria, Maeeda, and Tanisha turned to Sata, who stood in a corner
holding tightly onto Japheth. <sup>23</sup>God narrowed his eyes at them, and
Sata inhaled, fear inking their eyes.

"Satan? Is that you, my dearest?"

"Satan?" Gloria looked from God to Sata and back again. "As in Lucifer
the deceiver?"

"Sata is not a deceiver!" Japheth shielded Sata from their judging,
prying eyes.

"Is that what they told you?" God let out a half-suppressed laugh. "Did
they also tell you they loved you, and that beauty was many things?"

"What—" Japheth wanted to say something.

"Well, they told me the same things too, right before they tried to
usurp my throne and name themself the most beautiful of all the
celestials!"

"Wait... God was your toxic ex-boyfriend?" Japheth looked at Sata.

<sup>24</sup>God's eyes widened in disbelief. "First of all, I am nobody's ex.
And they were the toxic one!"

"I fled to earth because you wanted me dead," Sata stepped forward,
speaking for the first time since God appeared. "Then you literally sent
a flood to flush me out, you psychopath!"

"Wait, wait, time out, time out," Tanisha quieted everyone, knocking
together the edges of her hands. "God, first things first, did you send
a flood to flush out your ex, and in the process, drowned millions of
people and their families?" Tanisha brought a faux microphone to God's
mouth.

"How dare you question me?" God shoved the faux microphone out of His
face. "As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher
than your ways, and my thoughts higher than your thoughts!"

"Yes, he did," Sata answered in His stead. "And yes, I admit I have done
some heinous things, like the thing with Eve in The Garden of Eden,
which I take full responsibility for," Sata clasped their hands in
remorse. "But you are the evil in the world!"

"Oh shatafackup!" God spat, spittle flying out his mouth. "Listen and
listen well dearest. You will die in this place. I will shred you to
pieces, bit by bit, bone by bone, until you pray for death. Then I will
pluck your beautiful eyes from your skull, and your beautiful voice from
your tongue, and your beating heart from your chest, and I will set them
afire atop a pyre, atop a hill, and the vultures they will come, and
they will feast and feast, and I will take your trodden soul and—"

<sup>25</sup>Gloria punched God square in the face, her fist finding His nose,
crunching it up like biscuits.

"What in God's name—" God cried, holding up His bleeding nose. "I will
smite you where you stand, you filthy peasant wi—"

He did not get to finish that sentence. <sup>26</sup>Gloria punched Him again,
this time in the throat. And God wheezed back, choking on his saliva.
<sup>27</sup>Tanisha eagerly joined the tag team match, kicking God hard in the
balls. <sup>28</sup>Maeeda came running, grabbing God's head, and ramming her
knees into His gut. <sup>29</sup>God reeled to the ground, throwing up what was
probably a lovely brunch of sacrificed pigeons. <sup>30</sup>And the witches
stomped him. Their feet stomping his head, stomping his legs, stomping
his torso, stomping his butt cheeks. <sup>31</sup>The animals on the bleachers
cheered with every stomp.

<sup>32</sup>Gloria turned to Japheth and Sata. "Run! Get out of here!"

And like they were told, Japheth and Sata picked themselves up and ran.

<sup>33</sup>And through the stomping, God stretched forth his hand, grabbed
Maeeda by the throat, and flung her across the bunker. Maeeda went
sailing through the ark walls, her body smashing through pillars and
pillars of cypress wood.

"Maeeda!" <sup>34</sup>Tanisha went after her, morphing into a pterodactyl and
catching Maeeda mid-air, wrapping them in her wings before crashing into
wood and rubble. <sup>35</sup>Tanisha unwrapped her wings, and there was her
sister-in-law, hurt but alive.

"You saved me." Maeeda touched Tanisha's cheeks.

"You probably would have survived that."

"Still, here you are."

"Here I am." Tanisha softened, touching Maeeda's hand on her cheek.

<sup>36</sup>Where they had left them, God and Gloria battled it out. <sup>37</sup>God set
two bears on Gloria, and the old woman screamed. <sup>38</sup>Gloria slung a
stone in a slingshot striking God in the forehead, and the middle-aged
man cried hot tears. <sup>39</sup>God pushed Gloria down a well, and her wails
echoed. <sup>40</sup>Gloria squashed God's balls in her palms, both of them
screaming.

"Stay here." <sup>41</sup>Tanisha caressed Maeeda's hair before running off to
join the fight. She pulled another one of her blades and sped at God.
When she got to Him, she swiped her blade at Him, once, twice. <sup>42</sup>God
swerved, once, twice, the blade missing Him by a breath. Then God seized
Tanisha's hand, twisting the knife out of it. As it fell, God caught it,
and cleanly carved it into Gloria's neck. <sup>43</sup>Gloria did not scream; she
just stood there. <sup>43</sup>And God did not stop; He stabbed her again, and
again, and again. <sup>44</sup>Tanisha shrieked, leaping onto God's back,
tearing, and clawing at Him, trying to get Him to stop. God did not
stop. <sup>45</sup>When He finally did, He let go of Gloria, and the old woman
fell. <sup>46</sup>She fell silent.

<sup>47</sup>And God tore Tanisha off His back, flinging her away like a rag
doll. <sup>48</sup>And the three witches lay scattered across the ark floor.
Tanisha crawled over to Gloria. And so did Maeeda, and the women held
each other.

"Quickly, Tanisha, channel me; we need to heal her!" <sup>49</sup>Maeeda grabbed
Tanisha's hand, placing both their hands on Gloria's scarred and
bloodied body.

"Maeeda, I— I—" Tears choked Tanisha, keeping her from forming
words.

"What are you waiting for?!"

"Maeeda." Tanisha squeezed her sister-in-law's hand in hers and shook
her head. There was little they could do.

<sup>50</sup>And Maeeda wept, and she wept, and she wept, and Tanisha gathered
Maeeda in her arms, weeping with her, and still, it was not enough.

"My daughters." Gloria's voice wafted in, pale and drifting.

"Mama." Both women held their mother, her blood painting their skin, her
blood becoming their blood.

"Be mighty... as always."

<sup>51</sup>And a whale burst forth and swallowed Gloria's body.
<br /><br />

**Chapter 8: Maeedas**

<sup>52</sup>God scoffed, hands on His waist. "Forgive the intrusion, the old hag
was taking forever."

"I make you a promise," <sup>53</sup>Maeeda glared at Him with barren eyes,
avenging eyes. "You will die in this place."

"How dare you stand before my glory." With that, God became a blinding
light. He was ten thousand suns. Maeeda and Tanisha screeched, hiding
their faces, as the light singed their flesh. "I am the beginning and
the end. Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you. When the earth
totters, it is I who keep its pillars steady. Come, see as I ground
those pillars to dust."

<sup>54</sup>With that, the hosts of heaven descended upon the ark, upon the
earth. Angels of war in the brightest armor, atop chariots of fire,
their swords holy, fueled with righteous rage.

"Kill them slowly and decimate all of humanity just for fun." God
departed, cat-walking off the ark. "I have an ex to slay."

And the angels came slaughtering the survivors of the flood in their
thousands. And the angels came surrounding Tanisha and Maeeda. <sup>55</sup>And
in those final moments, there was no one in the world the two witches
would rather die beside.

*"On your left, Maeeda."*

"Who was that?" A startled Maeeda darted around, wiping her tears. "And
why are they quoting a line from Avengers: Endgame?"

"Maeeda, that—that sounded like you," Tanisha whispered after her.

<sup>56</sup>The voice was Maeeda's: a cybernetic Maeeda from the year 2556. As
the angels gathered in their multitudes, Cybernetic Maeeda clinked over
to Ark Maeeda, and stretched her bionic arm to her. "This is not where
we die."

<sup>57</sup>And Ark Maeeda took Cybernetic Maeeda's hand.

<sup>58</sup>And there came other Maeedas. Renaissance Maeeda, Stone Age Maeeda,
Gen-Z Maeeda, Middle-Grade Author Maeeda, Steam-Punk Maeeda, Roman
Emperor Maeeda, Bronze era Maeeda, Classical Maeeda, Power Puff Girl
Maeeda, Lego Maeeda, Inventor Maeeda, Assassin Maeeda, Transformers
Maeeda, Disney Princess Maeeda, Victorian Era Maeeda, Apocalypse
Maeeda.... <sup>59</sup>And like the angels, the Maeedas were multitude, too.

"Now that's how you use a time-warping future-telling seer ability!"
Tanisha cried with glee. "Kill these winged motherfuckers!" She pointed
another one of her many blades towards the angels.

<sup>60</sup>And the Maeedas and the angels of God went to war.
<br /><br />

**Chapter 8: Google Search: What to do if God is Your Toxic Ex-boyfriend?**

<sup>61</sup>Japheth and Sata ran out of the ark, up thirty hills, down thirty
valleys, and they kept running.

"Wait." <sup>62</sup>Sata stopped, and looked back, and turned into a pillar of
salt. <sup>63</sup>Sorry, wrong bible story. <sup>64</sup>Sata turned and looked back, far
into the distance, to the Ararat mountains where the ark now rested.
"The witches, they must need our help."

"Sata, they asked us to run."

"And we have. Maybe, this is where we turn back."

"Sata." Japheth held their face in his hands. "God wants to see you die
screaming. I will die before I let that happen."

"My love, when death comes for you, she will find me with daggers
drawn."

<sup>65</sup>And Japheth and Sata brought their foreheads to each other, and they
stayed in each other. It was decided. <sup>66</sup>They turned and headed back
for the ark, and there was God sitting in their path.

"I hate a love story that doesn't include me." God was boiling over with
envy and spite.

<sup>67</sup>Japheth attacked, charging forward. God flung him aside. "Peasant."

<sup>68</sup>Sata ran to their boyfriend, and God pulled them back. "Come here,
you little wench!" And God slapped them into the ground, the earth
cracking open as their tender body smashed into it. <sup>69</sup>Then God, like
the dramatic diva that He was, slowly and sexily crawled on top of Sata
and began pummeling their face into the earth.

"I told you I would break you to pieces!" God punched and punched, and
the cracks in the earth widened, spewing forth lava and hot ash.

"Please stop!" Japheth pleaded, bursting into tears as he tried to get
close, but the punches birthed earthquakes, and Japheth could barely
stand in the chaos.

"You should have loved me!" God cried, hammering Sata with more brutal
blows. "I wanted you to love me!"

"I did..." Sata moaned, blood spurting from all the cuts on their
beautiful face. "For a while."

<sup>70</sup>God held back His punches, His eyes softening. "Why did you stop my
love?"

"Because—because I realized you were a jealous egomaniac narcissistic
psychopathic bitch," Sata said calmly.

God flashed with rage and pestilence. "Arghhh!!!" <sup>71</sup>He screamed like a
tantrum-throwing toddler, lifting His fist once again. Bringing it down
upon Sata, someone caught His arm mid-air.

"Pick on someone your own size."

<sup>72</sup>It was Thor. Actually, She went by Thorine now. <sup>73</sup>And Thorine
swung Her hammer into God's face, sending Him skeeting across the
plains. And God rose from the plains, furious, seething with
retribution. <sup>74</sup>He sped at Thorine, but something, someone held his leg
back, and God tripped, falling flat on His face. And God looked back to
what had caused His fall.

<sup>75</sup>It was Lego Maeeda.

"What in God's name are you?" <sup>76</sup>God tried to banish her from his
presence, and another hand grabbed his arm. <sup>77</sup>It was Middle-Grade
author Maeeda.

<sup>78</sup>And all the Maeedas came in their multitude, they came besieging
God, and at the helm of command was Maeeda and Tanisha holding hands.

"I made you a promise." Maeeda looked God in the eyes. "I will keep it."

"What did you do with my angels!"

"We plucked and ate them." <sup>79</sup>Tanisha belched, a feather escaping her
mouth. <sup>80</sup>She glanced over at Thorine. "Girl, we got this."

And Thorine bade them farewell, spun Her hammer, and flew, disappearing
into the universe.

<sup>81</sup>Tanisha and all the Maeedas dragged God back to the ark, back to the
altar filled with water, and they held his head in the water, and God
tore, and God flailed, and they held him down. <sup>82</sup>And God drowned.
Then they chopped him to pieces, starting with his good side, and
sacrificed him on the altar to whatever mythical god was interested.
<br /><br />

**Chapter 8: Two by Two**

<sup>83</sup>As the animals exited the ark in pairs, so did Tanisha and Maeeda,
and Japheth and Sata. <sup>84</sup>The sun came forth, lighting the horizon in
radiant fire, bringing warmth to the earth. Grass peeped through soil,
reaching for light, leaning in the breeze. Music hummed from the ocean
depths, and the birds found wind, their songs sailing—

"Tanisha!" <sup>85</sup>Someone yelled, interrupting my melodic narration. <sup>86</sup>It
was Noah. He sauntered up the ramp, squeezing past two hippopotamuses.
"I have looked everywhere for the lot of you! Where is Gloria? Where is
every—"

"Get the hell out of our way!" <sup>87</sup>Tanisha pushed the old man aside, and
he fell off the ramp and died.

<sup>88</sup>I resumed my narration. The earth welcomed its saviors in an
embrace. Across the lands, high in the mountains, and deep in the seas,
the antelopes grazed, the mountain lions roared, and the whales
whistled, grateful to be—

"Maeeda!" <sup>89</sup>Another interruption. It was Shem.

"Can't we just have a moment!" Tanisha threw a tantrum, jumping and
stomping repeatedly on the ramp.

<sup>90</sup>Shem ran up to meet them, ducking under two giraffes.

"Maeeda, dearest wife, I have looked all over for you." He hugged her.
"Where have you been? Where is Father, Mother and Ham?" He looked to
Japheth.

"They are dead." Tanisha did not blink.

"What—what do you mean—"

<sup>91</sup>Without giving him a second to recover from the demise of his
parents and brother, "Shem, I want a divorce," Maeeda added.

"A divorce? What is a divorce?"

"Oh, apologies." Maeeda shook her head. "It's something I picked up from
the future."

"The future?"

<sup>92</sup>Maeeda heaved a tired sigh. "Shem, Tanisha is my girlfriend now."

Maeeda took Tanisha's hand, and Tanisha smiled a witchy, victorious
smile at Shem.

"I don't—I don't understand—"

Tanisha brought a finger to his lips, shushing him. "You don't need to.
But in summary, your wife is mine now."

"Okay. Bye now," Maeeda wrapped up the discussion as they left Shem in
discombobulation and continued down the ramp.

<sup>93</sup>And the four of them, Tanisha, Maeeda, Japheth, and Sata, sat on a
rock and watched the sunrise.

"Where do we go from here?" Maeeda broke the peaceful silence.

"Wherever we want." Japheth looked at her and smiled.

"So—ehm, Japheth, I was wondering if you'd like to come live with me,"
Sata squeaked shyly.

"Oh..."

"I was just thinking aloud, you certainly don't have to, only if you
want to. And it's okay if you don't want to. I know we just met and all,
but I—I really like you, and I think you're the prettiest boy I have
ever seen, and I—"

"So, where is this place you live?" Japheth took Sata's hand.

"Well... hell."

"Hell?"

"Yes, you know, me being the prince of hell and all." Sata gestured at
their horns. "And you being a demon now, you'd fit right in."

"Oh right." Japheth had forgotten that.

"It is a bit warm this time of year, the good kind of warm, but we can
go somewhere else if you're not okay—"

<sup>94</sup>Japheth kissed Sata, and a rainbow came arching above them, a sign
that God would never destroy the earth with a flood again. <sup>95</sup>But God
was gone, so it was now just a sign of their love.

"Yes, I'd love to go to hell with you."

Sata gleamed like five schoolgirls with stupid crushes.

"Can we come too?" Tanisha and Maeeda pleaded with puppy eyes.

"Yes, yes, you can come too."

And two by two, they all went to hell.

The End.
