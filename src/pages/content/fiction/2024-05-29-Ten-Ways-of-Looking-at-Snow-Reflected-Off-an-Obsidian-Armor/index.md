You were cruel when we first met.

It would have been easy to claim I was sleepwalking, under your
compulsion. But the truth was, I sought you out that midwinter night,
in my spiderweb-flimsy nightgown and bruised, bare feet, chasing after
a woodland vista I was taught through catechisms and beatings always
to avoid. I left my bed in the smallest of hours despite parents and
priests cautioning I stay away from the Erl-Queen's territory.
