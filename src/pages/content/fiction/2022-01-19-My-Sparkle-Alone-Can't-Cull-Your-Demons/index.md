author: Eric Farrell
issue: Issue Two, January 2022
description: Ainsley Miller flips the vanity mirror open in her pristine, bulbous vehicle. She’s been parked out front of a nondescript apartment in a rundown Westside neighborhood, trying to psych herself up for what’s to come. A thin mist coats her windshield, each raindrop a sphere of flaring purple sunset in the distance. <p> <em>It’s just a job</em>, she tells herself, staring out at the world, the tension so thick it buzzes throughout the entire dusty suburban beach town. </p><p>Two cops are waiting outside of the arched entrance leading into the apartment complex. They’re waiting on her, the local forensic officer. </p> <p>She’s not ready to confront them yet, lest they see her sparkle. </p>
