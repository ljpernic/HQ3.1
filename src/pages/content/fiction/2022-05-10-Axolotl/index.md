*At the Table*

I eat silence. It tastes lonely and bitter alongside ma’s watery yam casserole as it serrates speech from my tongue. In thirty years I haven’t learned how to digest this aching abyss. I turtle into my eight-year-old self, wondering: what aren’t ma and baba saying? Is the silence punishment for my inadequacy? No matter how I iterate myself, the recipe fails. Untethering from home, I’ve discarded my native language, abandoned the gods, adopted cutlery. Yet the minute I cross their threshold, artifice, concealment, and placation cloak my intentions.

“We called last week. You didn’t answer.”

“I was busy, baba.”

“Even to return a call? To let us know you’re safe?” He turns to ma. “Is this the modern girl?” 

“Don’t blame me. I wanted her securely settled. You insisted on graduate school, internship, certification.”  

I swallow down their disappointments. I don’t reveal that I lost my job last month—*How did this happen, Paloma? Did you not work hard enough?* And I don’t tell them I’m traveling to Venice tomorrow—*On your own? What’s this costing? Nothing there you can’t see here.* Instead, I flavor my limp green beans with the same-same prayer: gods, cook me another family. 
<br />
<br />
<br />
*On the Street*

Rain swamps my mouth. Venice smells of salted wood, Buildings leaning inward to avoid drowning. I quiz pontes and pester lanes in search of gondolas as a peddler peels from a lamppost, basket fermented in flowers.

“Da che parte per le gondole?” I ask, and the hawker spits, “stronzo turista!” *But I’m no threat*, I imagine shouting back. *I too am a body outcast*. The words flap uselessly in my throat, never taking flight. 

Instead, as I slink into the fog, a clamminess fattens upon my arm. I knead it until it loosens underneath my coat sleeve, puddling at my feet, a gelatinous limb jiggling like a suffocating eel. I recognize the knobby protuberance at its bend as the whorls of my elbow, the meshing phosphorescent threads as the splay of my brachial veins. I back away, let the appendage lie there, softly sulking. But when I leave the alley, I can feel it shadowing me, slithering in my wake. I hurry towards an algal aroma promising water’s edge and end at a decaying pier where gondolas wobble like tired ducks. The fading sun winks from a thousand glazed panes, igniting the city. At my ankle the phantom arm heaves in exhaustion. I wish I had a stick to prod it into the canal. Instead, I withdraw my feet and choose to ignore the l-shaped lump.
<br />
<br />

*Between the Houses*

My gondolier is taciturn, back as rigid as the pole he spoons into the inked canal. The channel narrows past entrances masticated by damp. Above the boggy deserted ground floors I hear the warm clink of dishes, crooning conversation. I reach out, like the forgotten plastic-jacketed furniture, longing for companionship. I cannot anchor into this slipping urbanity. 

Baroque chandeliers and crimson drapery garnish the palazzo, and a woman steps out in carnival mask and bouffant gown, collar gleaming like a bitten apple as she laughs. My lungs cramp with envy. I devour every detail of the jeweled lady against her glittering backdrop as the distance between us expands into an unbridgeable gulf and I lose the view. Wet slaps my heel and I find the duplicate arm flopping inside the skiff. It’s grown a hand and shoulder. 

I gasp, turning to the oarsman, who only looks ahead as our boat snakes into another duct. 

A second gondola ghosts out of the darkness cradling a couple. I stare at the man’s pleated shirt front saddling the night of his tuxedo, and he smiles, salutes with his champagne flute, startling me.

Is it a gesture of mockery? Is it meant for me? Does he…? No, I can’t believe such a fantasy about myself. Still, I preen, sucking on the memory like a candied lemon, sweetening the smile, zesting the twinkle in his eye, until I notice my spectral appendage has ballooned a torso beside me. It wriggles onto the seat, spinelessly quivering while two legs and feet bulge into being. I gulp in frustration, horrified by its tumescence. 

I eye the reeds where refugees once hid, before the wealth of silk and spice leeched the marshes. How many bones mattress this metropolis and what would happen to me if I shoved my doughy double into that mix? Would I vanish too? Would my life rust into salvage? Would I merge into the ocean, kinless? 

My twin mushrooms into its other arm, clasps my shoulder with its gummy digits. I wince. I cannot allow it to birth a face.
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Under the Weight*

I stumble-run towards my lodging, body-double skinning the pavement beside me. In my jungled state, I can’t remember if I paid the gondolier. I wrench from the duplicate at my side, but its grip only lowers, hooking into my arm crook, then palming my hand. I shudder, energy ebbing. Against the obscure passages of Venice, my shoes tattoo a dirge until I pause, panting. 

Voices bruise out of an alcove. A couple whose faces I cannot see. 

“Tell me something truthful,” a woman’s rasp demands.

“Okay,” a man answers meekly. “You were great in bed.”

“Tell me a truth I don’t know.” 

“You’re my other half?”	

“You’re such a liar. The entire time we were together you lied, and you’re lying now.” 

“No, really, you and I belong together. I miss you.” 

“What about—? Do you miss her?” 

I stop breathing to hear the answer, but only the canal carrying absence on its back replies. I unkink my muscles from the viscous facsimile. *Do you miss her. Do you miss her*. I long to be like the smudged and swiftly flowing water below, belonging to no one, not even itself—*Unwanted*.

The second Paloma vibrates through me, gorging on my thoughts, and I slurp the moist air between my teeth. I know what will happen. This desire will leech into my marrow, poisoning me cell by single cell until all that’s left of me is stained flesh. 

I know what I must do.

I lock the door to my hotel room, fill a glass with tap water, and lie on the white bed. I pretend the mannequin—me is a lover as I nibble on the wax-melted thumbs caked around my wrists, working up the jellied forearms, the pressed curd elbow, the mushy biceps, until I’m biting morsels so large they skid painfully down my esophagus. I gag but persist to the shoulder. If I stop now, I won’t be able to finish. My stomach gurgles and twists with the weight of fears, bile swelling, replicating upwards. I coil over my gnawed corpse, moaning. To acknowledge all my insecurities at once is excruciating. 

I lurch to the bathroom and retch over and over again until only air expels from my gut. The vinegary strands orbit in their bleach pond as I flush repeatedly, hoping the bobbing bits of angst will depart. On the tousled sheets the leftover body trembles, congealing around its shrunken self. I shift the weight on my knees, hugging the porcelain bowl, and wait for the fizzing relief of an unburdened belly. 

I am what the world sees: a boundless hunger. My ribs a tunnel towards doubt. My liver a lake of apologies. My heart never good enough for the acceptance I crave. 

Huddled over the hotel toilet, above its floating shreds of misery, I dream of a cleansing river to flood me. Purified, mythic waters, far from these stagnant canals to cover me in compassion so that I might regenerate.
