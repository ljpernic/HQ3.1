description: "Cass can't bring herself to watch her brother burn. All the websites say you should, and that you should also watch as they scrape the ash up and put it in the urn. That you should not take your eyes off your loved one at all. <p>She doesn't understand how anyone could follow that advice. </p><p>She stays in the waiting area, sitting in one of the hard plastic chairs. There is a bereavement room with a couch and a small table where
people can sit and weep in something closer to comfort, but to Cass it feels too small and... full. Full of sadness and confusion and the ache
of stale loneliness. Her grief needs more space. Her grief is bigger than a small room already crowded with painful echoes.</p>"

He thought drowning would feel blissful. Scary at first, the panic of
breathlessness, but then pleasant and mostly serene. He had already
decided that, when the time came, he would be eclipsed from this life
with a mangled *Manfred* quote: "It is not so difficult to die, after
all."

It was not peaceful.

The salt stung the inside of his torso, his ribs turned to knives that
sliced him open. His very blood felt like an attack: an enemy of his own
making. He swallowed mouthful after mouthful of seawater. His throat
burned, his stomach distended to bursting. The sound of the ocean filled
his ears: a beast, roaring with aquatic laughter. Manfred? Who's
Manfred?
