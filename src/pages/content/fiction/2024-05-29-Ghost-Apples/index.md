Cathilde pulled her foot back, shuddering at the sight. The rabbit was
just outside the tent, laid out like an offering. Beady brown eyes
stared up at a sky the colour and texture of meringue; its soft white
fur rippled in the crisp wind, and a spray of red berries grew out of
its mouth, covered in a thin lace of frost.

The first time it happened, Aglahé had sliced open the
rabbit's—seemingly innocuous—belly to reveal a furl of pale flowers
growing between its organs. The second time, a tangle of roots had grown
overnight next to their tent, a white pheasant encased in its coils. The
third, they had opened a handful of chestnut shells, only to find quail
chicks nestled inside.
