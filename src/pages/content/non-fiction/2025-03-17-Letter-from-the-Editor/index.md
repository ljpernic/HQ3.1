Dear Reader,

I am so very happy to report that our Kickstarter was a success and we are funded
through the rest of 2025 to pay pro rates! I am shy by nature, but please take a
moment to hear my ragged voice cheering across time and space in celebration
that we managed it. And you know what? It wouldn't have been possible without
you, so yes, you should absolutely be cheering as well. Let us join in a roaring
chorus of hooping and hollering so loud that we shake the rafters of creation.
Who knew I could get so excited about fundraising?

But I kid, I kid, what I'm actually excited about is that we can now bring you a heap
of fiction and poetry, short fiction reviews and interviews. A whole year's worth, in
fact. I did the math and about 93% of our budget this year will go directly to our
authors and artists. And the cool thing is that as we publish more, our overhead
doesn't increase, so the percentage of money for creators just grows and grows. 

We ended up with 124 backers and raised $4697, so give another cheer and buckle
up for an exciting year of fiction and poetry, starting with this outstanding issue.
Read it and tell everyone that if they haven't subscribed to Haven Spec Magazine
for 2025, they are missing out!

Thank you again, dear reader, for all of your support over the last few years. With
your help, we will have many more to come.

With a skip in my step and a song in my heart,<br />
Leon
