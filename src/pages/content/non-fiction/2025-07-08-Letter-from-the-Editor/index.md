Dear Reader,

The last few months have taken roughly ten thousand years, a time dilation so bad
it's got me shouting *Murph!* and reading Dylan Thomas poetry. The thing I hated
about Interstellar was that they named the bad guy Dr. Mann and told us "he was
the best of us" over and over. All Matt Damon was missing to broadcast his evil
was a mirror-Spockian goatee because as metaphors go, Dr. Mann is as subtle as
a frying pan to the head, a real this-is-your-brain-on-drugs level of metaphor,
and please, are there any questions? But time dilation is real, and dry land is not
a myth, I've seen it, along with all the heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
that flesh is heir to. And so I missed the May issue entirely.

I tell my students each semester that there were years of my life when I was younger
that I basically only spoke in Simpsons quotes, and it's an exaggeration but not by
much. Sometimes it's easier to find the right feelings to express in quotes (because
you can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel
angry, which, okay, is a Futurama quote, but still).

So, here goes: In April, my dad fell and hit his head (Steve Urkel saying, "I've fallen
and I can't  get up!" because the 90s medical alert version is too real). He went into
the hospital and didn't come out again (something from Scrubs, but all that comes
to mind is Ted saying, "Too much ha ha, pretty soon boo hoo," which still feels
apt). I spent much of May and June in New Orleans organizing things (Cowboy
Mouth's Fred LeBlanc wailing, "Take me back to New Orleans and drop me at my
door!"). And then he died (I reach for a quote but nothing comes to mind).

When I sat down to write this, I told myself to stay positive and not get too
melancholy (always look on the bright side of life?), but there's a surprising amount
of work that goes into organizing the end of someone's life. Death is big—so big
it bends the bonds of time and space. And so, the last few months have somehow
felt like an age has passed, but also like I looked down for a moment in April and
when I looked back up it was mid-June and there was so much *stuff* to do. Like
I'm Théoden of Rohan and Wormtongue's spell has been lifted and I'm shouting
"Arise, arise, Riders of Théoden! Ride for Ruin and the world's ending!" but only
if Théoden had a tiny voice in the back of his head that's Milhouse Van Houten
saying, "So this is what it feels like when doves cry."

Take care of yourself, dear reader, and as always, thank you for reading,

Leon
