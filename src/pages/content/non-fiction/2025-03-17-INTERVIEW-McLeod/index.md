<strong>TJ Price:</strong> Hi, Lindz! Thanks for agreeing to engage with these questions! I’m
fascinated by your work, and have been ever since I first read a short story submission
of yours (“The Sunbathers”) for Cosmic Horror Monthly, in which it was inevitably
published. <a href='https://cosmichorrormonthly.com/fiction/the-sunbathers/'>(Issue #42, Cosmic Horror Monthly)</a> I was immediately struck by the
polished, assured prose and the vibrant, daring voice behind it. The descriptive
language was a delight, a host of metaphor and simile that roared with abandon
across the entire sensory spectrum. Following my read of this—even before it was
accepted for publication!—I immediately sought out and bought your first collection
of short fiction, <em>Turducken</em>.

I am continually impressed by your willingness and curiosity to examine and
employ different avenues of narrative. In <em>Turducken</em>, you experiment with language
and form quite a bit. Can you tell us about what it is that excites you when it comes
to experimental approaches to fiction—either in your own, or reading it in others…
or even both, if you feel so inclined?

<strong>Lindz McLeod:</strong> I love the idea of finding new ways to tell stories; I think at heart I’m
a playful, mildly unserious person, and that definitely comes across in <em>Turducken</em>;
there’s a triptych of flashes in there about a threesome (two human, one not) where
the non-human person can only speak with certain limitations. At first, she can
only speak in Philip Pullman plotlines, and later it’s dialogue from Frasier… Deeply
unserious, but deeply fun to play with. There’s no idea too ridiculous to try at least
once—that’s my motto.

Ironically, while being unserious, I often discover I’m actually telling an emotional
story after all. When I first began writing “Cipher” (a story told via crossword clues,
which does actually fit into a real crossword), I just wanted to see if it could work,
but it ended up being a story about yearning and imperfection and figuring out how
to be true to yourself.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Followup question! Can you recall a time in which you read something that
expanded your concept of the capabilities of fiction? What was that thing?

<strong>LM:</strong> Carmen Maria Machado’s <em>Her Body and Other Parties</em> really kicked it off; I
admired the way she played with form, structure, and broke the 4th wall by not
simply addressing the reader directly but ordering them to complete certain
actions. After that, I started reading more experimental fiction in general. As part of
my PhD research, I’m looking at ways in which authors can ‘disrupt’ fiction—how
we can play with text, what we can remove or change and still maintain an intimate
connection with the reader. I’ve read works so far which play with format: Jennifer
Egan’s <em>A Visit From the Goon Squad</em> where one entire chapter is in Powerpoint format
(could anyone but Egan pull that off?), George Saunders’ <em>Lincoln In The Bardo</em>, Mark
Dunn’s <em>Ella Minnow Pea</em>, with dozens still on my list to read. Life is too short to read
all the books, isn’t it? Such a shame.

<strong>TJ:</strong> You currently live in Edinburgh—which I had the pleasure of visiting myself
recently, and which I found absolutely fascinating, absolutely marinated in a very
old brew of history. Do you think the city (and its environs!) influences what and
how you write at all? If so, how?

<strong>LM:</strong> Oh absolutely! It feels like every single street in Edinburgh has some weird
historical fact attached to it, and because Scottish people have quite dark senses of
humour, some of them can be quite grim. For instance, there’s a longstanding pub
called <em>The Last Drop</em> in the Grassmarket, about forty feet from where one of the
gallows sites used to be. The name of the pub can be read as a comment on the act
itself, but it was also the place where the condemned were given a final drink before
being hanged (a last ‘drop’ of beer).

Although I don’t often write stories which take place in Edinburgh itself—because so
many writers do, particularly crime writers—I do feel that the overall atmosphere
has imbued a lot of my writing with a kind of dark and gothic feel. There’s often
something lurking underneath the text, waiting to burst out when my characters
least expect it.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Followup question! If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you
choose, and why?

<strong>LM:</strong> Probably New York, where I first met my wonderful fiancée; I love the sheer
scope of the city, and even on my first trip it felt like a familiar place to me. There’s
always so much to see and do. That being said, I’ve long harboured a desire to live
in nature; a little log cabin somewhere in the woods would suit me perfectly for the
months during which I’m writing intensively. If money was no issue, I’d probably
spend six months a year in a city and six months in the middle of nowhere.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Much of your work defies genre, and yet a lot of it also embraces aspects and
elements of various genres wholeheartedly. Can you tell us a little bit about how the
idea of genre intersects with your work?

<strong>LM:</strong> In some ways I love the categorization of genre, because it lets me cross
over and mash them up, and in some ways I find it hard to manage; not all of
my work is so easy to label. And at the same time, I delight in subverting tropes—<em>Sunbathers</em>, 
which came out in September, is about an entirely different kind of
vampire breed, powered by the sun. I was tired of seeing the stereotypical vampire
shrouded in darkness, and I had this very clear mental image of a bronzed, eightpacked 
vampire sleeping in a tanning bed instead of a coffin. Instead of the broody creature of 
the night, they’re WASPy, <em>Jersey Shore</em> influencer types. To me, that’s
even more frightening, but it was also deeply fun and tongue-in-cheek to play with
those familiar tropes and see what could be done to make them feel fresh and new
and still horrifying to the reader.

<strong>TJ:</strong> How we choose to define ourselves vis-a-vis not only our actions, but also what we
love (and what we hate, to a degree)—is a big part of your recently-published novella,
Sunbathers. In it, to my thinking, there is a theme of how necessary authenticity is
despite pressure (both internal and external!) to seek perfection. Can you talk about
how identity and authenticity inform the life of characters in your work?

<strong>LM:</strong> My characters are so often struggling with doing what they want versus doing
the right thing, and rarely do the twain meet! <em>Sunbathers</em> is an extreme example of
my usual approach to writing, which is usually ‘a character has plucked at my sleeve
and demanded to be noticed/followed’. I knew from the beginning that Soph was
not inherently a very nice person, which is something I find fascinating to both
write and read, but I wanted to encourage all her worst aspects to see what might
happen. To that effect, every time she had to make a decision, I allowed her to
make the most selfish, awful choice possible—while still trying to make sure that
the reader could follow her reasoning.

Often, people aren’t evil or malicious because they set out to be; they’re simply
selfish or afraid or angry, and those emotions drive them to make particular choices.
Under extreme pressure, under duress, under fear for our lives, I think most people
in Soph’s position would also be quite selfish. There’s something honest about her,
at least; if we dare to hold a mirror up to humanity’s worst faces, then I think we owe
it to ourselves to meet our own gazes. How can we be the best versions of ourselves
if we don’t know the deepest depths we’d sink to? How can we improve our flaws
if we don’t even acknowledge them to begin with? And even if we could fix all our
problems in a heartbeat, with a single act—should we? Doesn’t that mean we’ve
skipped over the genuine hard work of growth and simply papered over the cracks
in our souls?

You can tell I’m marrying a psychiatrist, can’t you?

<strong>TJ:</strong> What is your favorite kind of wind? Does it have a name? If not, please name it
for us.

<strong>LM:</strong> It probably says a lot about me that I went down a Google rabbit hole about
types of wind before I was prepared to commit to answering this question. I think
a ‘wuther’ (made famous by Emily Brontë’s classic novel, <em>Wuthering Heights</em>) is my
favourite—as long as I’m indoors. There’s something wonderful about being cosy
inside while wind wuthers at your windows.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Regardless of one’s political leanings or beliefs, it is quite clear we are currently
living in a time of turbulence when it comes to our climate—some scientists even
believe we have come to the end of the Holocene. Your fiction has touched on the
delicate (and symbiotic!) balance of humanity and the environment repeatedly—
never moreso than in Sunbathers—and from what I’ve read, it seems that your
forthcoming novella We, the Drowning will also investigate the relationship we have
with the Earth. Do your fears (and hopes) for the future of our planet influence what
you choose to explore in fiction?

<strong>LM:</strong> Absolutely. The older I get, the more aware of mortality I am—in both personal
terms and planetary terms. In the post-apocalyptic landscape of <em>We, The Drowning</em>,
young Cole decides to try to bridge the gap between his tribe, the Parched, and the
opposing tribe, the Flooded, who believe that humanity has done so much damage
to the world that the best thing we can do now is remove ourselves entirely and
allow nature to ‘heal’. They’re essentially a suicide-cult, who drown themselves
ritually, and recruit Parched people whenever they can. The Parched hate this,
as they believe in reparations from each person, and believe that the Flooded are
ruining their final chance to give back to the Earth in some small way.

I can see both sides of the argument—the nihilism vs the optimism, the despair and
dread vs the faith and hope. We’re experiencing once-in-a-century storms every
decade now, and in some cases more often. The effects of climate change grow
more visible every year. Huge corporations would like us to direct that anger and
panic and guilt inwards, to blame ourselves for not utilizing every single possible
waste-reduction measure, in order to shift the focus from their own activities. And
yet without that desire for change arising from an individual level, rising up to
forge a giant, Clive-Barker-esque hand to squeeze the throat of capitalism, I don’t
know how else we can face the problem. Divided, we dessicate.

<strong>TJ:</strong> One of my favorite things about you—and there are many!—is your continued
willingness to engage with the writing community at large. You not only offer
editorial critique, coaching and mentorship, but you also have a project coming up
soon with Stanchion called <em>An Honour and a Privilege</em>, in which you will collaborate
with other writers to create fiction alongside discussion of certain craft techniques.
This is not a question so much as a statement of gratitude—such generosity of spirit
is a rare, beautiful thing, and I wanted to give you a little space to talk about your
thoughts when it comes to interacting with a community of other writers, if you so
choose to.

<strong>LM:</strong> Thank you! I really appreciate that, because it’s such an ambitious project and
I’m so grateful that these twelve wonderful writers agreed to work with me—some
even agreed before I’d fully explained the idea, which amused (and worried) me. I
came up with the idea in the first place because my mentees and clients often asked
me what craft books to read, and though I had some suggestions, I found them
lacking with respect to the bigger picture. Often the book will explain the technique
and show a single example of a paragraph or two, but it doesn’t show how that
fits into an overall story. As I keep saying, you wouldn’t teach someone to paint a
landscape by showing them a single tree, so why do we try to teach writing craft in
such marked isolation?

Over the course of 12 months from July 2024 to June 2025, I’ll create one piece of
fiction and an accompanying piece of non-fiction with each writer; everyone has
been assigned a specific month. My hope is to create a unique kind of craft book—
one that explores different techniques but showcases them by showing the entire
‘big picture’ of a story, not just a portion or paragraph. It’s been incredibly fun and
challenging in ways that I couldn’t have foreseen; in order to create a smooth piece
of fiction, I’ve had to learn to mimic each of their voices in turn—and they are all 
very different writers and have chosen very different genres and time periods!

No matter how much I learn, there’s always something new—some new format or
phrasing I’ve never seen before, that forces my perspective to shift, that forces me
to redraw the boundaries of what is possible. And also, I firmly believe that while the
publishing industry pits writers against writers, we’re not really in competition with
each other. I never want to pull up the ladder behind me; I’d rather reach back and
lend a hand. A rising tide lifts all boats, after all.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Followup question (yes, an actual question): you are affianced to Z. K. Abraham,
who is a fantastic (in both senses of the word!) writer as well, with work published in
such venues as <em>FANTASY Magazine</em> and <em>Fractured Lit</em>. (Read her stunning flash piece
“The Unction” in <em>Fractured Lit</em> <a href='https://fracturedlit.com/the-unction/'>here</a>) What’s it like to be in a long-term relationship
with another artist—and another writer, to boot? Are your walls threatening to cave
in under the weight of your combined books?

<strong>LM:</strong> One of our bookshelves actually did collapse last year—whoops. After that, we
bought new, sturdier shelves, and I was gently reminded that even solid wood has a
breaking point. I’ve made more of an effort lately to read and donate books rather
than hanging onto them, which ironically enables me to buy new books.

Apart from the constant struggle over too many books (I maintain that’s not actually
a thing) she’s my first reader and I’m hers; I know she’ll give me her honest opinion,
and I also know that our strengths and weaknesses balance each other out well,
resulting in finished pieces which feel well-rounded. We do spend a lot of time
discussing writing in general, sharing books we’ve read, or asking for opinions/
advice on plot holes etc. Writing can often feel like quite a lonely activity, and having
someone there who really understands the struggle on myriad levels is incredible;
from ‘I’ve written this damn paragraph four times and it’s still wrong’ to ‘Sorry
but I’m on a roll and can’t tear myself away to cook dinner tonight’, she’s always
understanding and supportive.

However, we make time for other things—she has a real job, I have my PhD, and we
both have memberships to two local cinemas as well as our own hobbies. I believe
that you have to input art to output art; an engine doesn’t run on wishes alone.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Do you have a favorite quote from a writer that you’d like to share? Bonus points
if it’s also about the craft of writing. Extra bonus points if you explain why you like
it so much. (Points may be redeemed at the Haven Spec Gift Shop.)

<strong>LM:</strong> Clarice Lispector: “I elaborate things very unconsciously. Sometimes people
think I’m not doing anything. I’m sitting in a chair, and I just sit there. Not even I
realize that I’m doing something. Suddenly, a sentence comes.”

I understand what Lispector means. I’m often doing something else entirely—
watching TV with Z, or playing with the cats, or walking through a park—or
sometimes nothing at all, and suddenly, the lightning strikes. Writing feels like
sculpture to me; it’s either something that I chip away at, discovering the shape as 
I go, or else lightning cracks the marble and the unnecessary parts slough off in an
instant and it’s my job to preserve that as quickly as I can. It’s the closest thing to
magic I’ve ever felt.

<strong>TJ:</strong> The bio on your website (lindzmcleod.com) mentions that your work has been
adapted for <em>avant-garde opera</em>? Please tell us more! How did this come to pass? What
was it like?

<strong>LM:</strong> Colombian-American soprano Stephanie Lamprea reached out to me; she was
doing her PhD at St Andrew’s/Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and had read a poem
of mine that translates as “to drown oneself” that she thought would work perfectly
in a project she was putting together. I think my favourite line was “the world is my
zoo; it pushes me out” which became such a powerful line in Stephanie’s mouth.
The project eventually became an album, and I got to see her perform my poem
live at an event in Edinburgh, which was so surreal and beautiful. She has a truly
incredible voice, so pure and potent.

<strong>TJ:</strong> I am of the firm belief that multiple forms of creative expression are essential
to the artist, not only for a shift in perspective but also using a different part of
the brain, to exercise cognition in a more holistic fashion. Do you have any other
creative media that you turn to when needing a break from writing/publishing?

<strong>LM:</strong> I have to admit my hobbies tend to fall by the wayside a little when I’m deeply
immersed in a project! I’m a terrible workaholic and it’s so easy to get sidetracked
by a fun writing project. This is something I’d like to actively change next year, and
ideally I’d like to try something where I can work with my hands, like carpentry.
Due to having multiple memberships, I see a huge amount of films in cinemas—last
year I saw over 100! I also play guitar and have my own bow, though I haven’t taken
it out lately.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Followup question: are there other forms of art which inspire you to create
fiction, such as certain pieces of music, or paintings, or sculpture, or (fill in the
blank)?

<strong>LM:</strong> All of the above! I love visiting to museums and art galleries, and in Edinburgh
there’s always some new and exciting exhibit going on. Sometimes I go off down
a random rabbithole with my PhD research, which introduces me to strange new
bedfellows. <em>The Unlikely Pursuit of Mary Bennet</em>, my historical romance which is
coming out next year (and follows a newly widowed Charlotte Lucas falling in love
with scientist Mary Bennet) was largely written to the dulcet harmonies of Vitamin
String Quartet playing a variety of pop songs (and most often, Robyn’s ‘Dancing On
My Own’ for the sad bits).

<strong>TJ:</strong> As mentioned, your work is often highly evocative, transmitting a full gamut of
the human sensory experience—not just what can be seen, but what is heard, scented,
felt and tasted—sometimes evoked in an ecstatic, quasi-synaesthetic fashion. Your
recent keynote speech at Liverpool University’s Current Research in Speculative
Fiction conference (CRSF) was specifically about vision and the role that sight plays
in fiction, too. Can you speak a little bit about how alternative sensory experiences
(apart from our dominant sense, sight) can enhance and enrich fiction?

<strong>LM:</strong> After I had Covid in early 2020, I lost my ability to identify smells and tastes. I
can still experience them, but they are ephemeral and once gone, I can’t recall what
they felt like beyond an odd, synaesthetic description. This has improved my prose,
since I’m forced to identify the ‘feeling’ using other senses, and I pushed myself to
get even more creative about it. I often try to describe one sense by using another: a
strawberry evokes a particular taste, but what shape is that flavour on your tongue?
If it was a musical note, would it be a high one or a low one? Sustained or brief? In
order to make up for what I lack, I seek to reach the reader through other roads. 

Humans are inherently visual creatures—it’s in our biology—but by fixating on
vision and sound alone in a fictional scene, it ends up feeling quite two dimensional
and flat. By pushing beyond that comfort zone and describing the other senses,
your reader will feel much more immersed; how often, after all, have you realized
that the place you’re standing in has no smell at all? Probably not often. It’s a subtle
distinction but smells and tastes and textures, whether positive or negative, are
incredibly powerful ways to transport your reader to another place and time.

<strong>TJ:</strong> How about a quick haiku about your favorite season?

<strong>LM:</strong> Yellow trumpet, pink crown<br />
Birthing blossom; fresh, damp, green<br />
The lion/lamb season<br />

<strong>TJ:</strong> Finally, I’d like to give you a little space to talk about any forthcoming projects
from other writers that you’re excited about, or perhaps anything you’ve read
recently that really affected you!

<strong>LM:</strong> I’ve just written my tenth blurb of the year, so I’d love to shout out Lyndsie
Manusos’ <em>These Dark Abodes</em> and Rae Wilde’s <em>I Can Fix Her</em>—both excellent books I
devoured in a day and then was allowed to scream about in blurb form (always a
treat). I recently read Cristín Leach’s raw, poignant memoir <em>Negative Space</em> as well
as Kirsten Bakis’ tragic, elegant <em>Lives of the Monster Dogs</em>, and felt somehow altered
by both; Leach and Bakis have a way of presenting simple stories on the face of
extremely complicated emotions, which is not an easy thing to achieve well.

<strong>TJ:</strong> Thanks so much again for participating in this interview, Lindz!
