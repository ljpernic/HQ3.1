The summer Mom died,<br />
I summoned you<br />
From vulture feathers,<br />
From discarded cicada husks,<br />
From car-wrecked armadillos,<br />
Legs surrendered to the eternal, burning sky.<br />
I summoned you from the hole in my gut<br />
Where my longing leaked out,<br />
Where heat and humidity seeped in.<br />

And you came,<br />
You with legs of the maimed and discarded<br />
You with insect song thrumming in your thorax<br />
You with wings of oiled midnight.<br />
You smelled of my decaying despair,<br />
Of the unbearable weight of summer<br />
The heaviness of air which would not rain.<br />

When school started, my classmates mocked<br />
The stench that clung to my pores,<br />
The grit-grime of my neglected childhood.<br />
But the grief which branded me outcast<br />
Was my shield, too.<br />
Beloved sibling, all I long for is night<br />
When I crawl into your comforting embrace.<br />
In the hot stink of your darkness,<br />
At last, I am loved.<br />
