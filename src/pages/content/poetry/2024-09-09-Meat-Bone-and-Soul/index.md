no<br />
I will not<br />
be your princess<br />
no matter how you layer me<br />
in silks and pearls<br />
no matter the finery of your tailors<br />
these gowns will never fit<br />
this strange body that binds my soul<br />

by dark magic and obstinance<br />
you've skinned me of scales<br />
split my tail into legs<br />
reminded me repeatedly<br />
that because of you<br />
I can never again <br />
survive the stormy brine<br />

yet the sea calls me<br />
its brutal roar preferable<br />
to your dulcet tones<br />

you think to lock<br />
me in the corsets<br />
of your effusive adjectives<br />
as if your words and cakes<br />
and brushed velveteen<br />
will anchor me to these stones<br />
wean me of the temptation<br />
of the waves<br />

you're wrong<br />

I have taught myself<br />
to read your grimoires<br />
by the light of my old friend<br />
the moon<br />
I seek ways to become<br />
as I once was <br />

and if that fails<br />
if I must flee from you<br />
into the deep<br />
so be it<br />

the water that may<br />
fill my lungs<br />
will be heavy, that is true<br />
but if I stay on dry land<br />
the burden of your<br />
fantasy<br />
will drown me slow and sure<br />

whether the waters<br />
rot me amid the sandy deep<br />
or cast me upon foreign shores<br />

I will abide<br />
by the ocean's callous truth<br />
for it is what I live by<br />
even now:<br />
I am meat, bone, and soul<br />
no more<br />
no less<br />
this jeweled crown upon my brow<br />
mere jetsam<br />
