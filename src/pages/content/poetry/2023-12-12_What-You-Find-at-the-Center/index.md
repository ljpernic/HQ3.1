<p style="text-align: center;"><em> after @notaleptic</em> </p>

six feet down and you sat <br />
in the garden filling your notebooks <br /> 
with scrawled labyrinths; circus tents <br /> 
overlapping the paths and midways. <br />

ten feet down and you cried <br />
over some girl who liked math and uppers <br /> 
better than cartography or tracing <br /> 
the lines she drew between you or me. <br />

fourteen feet down and you're a bad dream. <br />
my mother says I never had a friend like you <br />
and she would know.  I have your notebook, <br />
followed it here, carrying a shovel. <br />

twenty feet down and here is tile, a floor <br /> 
patterned in your doodle loops, inlaid <br />
green as your eyes in your brown face <br /> 
when you made me promise not to tell. <br /> 

I didn't tell, even when the cops <br />
came. how does Mom not remember <br /> 
feeding the police brownies while <br />
they asked me if you talked about a boyfriend, <br />

if you had plans to run away. I said no, <br />
you never talked about boys, did not say <br />
a word about girls, drawings, carnivals <br />
or your dreams of falling deep below the earth, <br />

following the guides you took with you, <br />
leaving only the one meant for me. my hands blister, crack. <br />
When they bleed onto the soil <br />

the tile slides away. my hands jerk empty. <br />
I fall <u>breathless</u>, tumbling, <br />
praying there's a net to catch me, a tent <br />
full of townies to be rooked. <br />

my hands grab air. you're <br />
the girl who ran away with the circus and I <br />
have come in the third act to join you. <br /> 
the earth has swallowed me up like <br />

an endless tunnel of love ridden solo.  I stop <br /> 
hard, thudding painless in darkness <br /> 
that smells like salt and honey and dust, <br />
no popcorn, no fried dough, but a hint <br />

of shit and straw and regret. <br />
but there’s no big top in sight, <br />
no Ferris wheel creak, no light, <br />
like the circus left town when I hit. <br />

I feel your unmistakable hand slip <br />
into mine, hear your voice tell me <em>don’t panic</em>. <br />
<em>Let’s go</em>. There’s no ringmaster but someone’s watching, <br />
someone’s in the boneyard still. <br /> 

so I play pretend, tell my panic it’s only a <br />
practical pop quiz, follow the familiar cues <br />
that don't smell like you but walk in your <br /> 
hop-skip rhythm in your clacking shoes, <br />

silent fearing a spell, me who never <br />
runs out of words, eyes fixed forward like <br />
a cautious Orpheus. Whose hand <br /> 
is in mine as I turn back toward the surface mapless? <br />
