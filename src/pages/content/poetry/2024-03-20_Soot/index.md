    look behind, <br /> "

Smoke eats into the cloud like rust <br />
chewing out the doors of a decrepit bus. <br />
I push the wind in my throat into a cough, <br />
black spittle on my palms, the colour of night— <br />
I've inhaled too much of this darkness, but <br />
I'm human made-for-breath. In spite of my <br />
dread for cigarettes, the air winds me to the <br />
height of a smoker. I cull a song with my breath <br />
of carbon, for my brother’s eighteenth birthday. <br /> 
My mother wraps her hands into prayer—deep <br />
inside the water—says may the Lord submerge <br />
our sufferings like the water drowning our homes.
