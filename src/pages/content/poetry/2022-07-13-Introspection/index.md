Hell-storm overtaking the hills, <br />
the blistering winds come forever now. <br />
<br />
Listen in the new black dawn <br />
to the end of space and time. <br />
<br />
Hellfire all around, a hurricane of dirt and splinters. <br />
The seas dried up just before the sun was lost. <br />
<br />
Look into the doom of red stars, darkening <br />
stars, and thrashing cinders. Look into <br />
<br />
the horror in the mirror becoming <br />
the horror in the world. <br />
