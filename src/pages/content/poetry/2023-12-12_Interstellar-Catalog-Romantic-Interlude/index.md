On this world all the colors are named anew <br />
with each child.  I have a word for yellow & <br /> 

a word for blue, but it will not help me talk <br /> 
to another soul in this city.  We point to <br /> 

the sun & the sky and the piped icing <br /> 
& buttercream roses on these small <br /> 

cakes we picked out from the bakery. <br /> 
On this world we agree on the sweet <br /> 

chew of the crumbs, the strange <br /> 
way bones are hidden in a hand as it holds <br /> 

another’s, how fingers can be warm & <br />
yielding and impenetrably solid all at <br />

once.  The names for the colors are personal. <br /> 
Untranslatable. But we try teaching each other, <br />

we do, because we think that is what love is. <br />
I tell you what I have named the sudden <br />

blush of your cheek, you tell me the name <br />
you have given the shining swoop of my hair <br />

in sunlight.  Of course we see the same thing <br />
because physics demands it, calls it precision. <br />

But our hearts must authorize the way we see <br />
things, too.  When I learn what you call blue, <br />

my favorite of all the skies in the universe, I <br />
cannot stop the disappointment flashing <br />

through me.  Still we count the ways we are alike & <br />
we count the ways we are compatible & <br />

we count the ways we understand each other. <br /> 
I count the days until we will no longer be willing <br /> 

to translate: your eyes, Rayleigh scattering, the shift <br />
as I leave to witness the next system. <br />
