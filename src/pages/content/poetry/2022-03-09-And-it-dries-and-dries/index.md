In my mind a butterfly catches pneumonia: <br />
Flap flap the world is changed. <br />
<br />
There’s a second life but not a first, <br />
there’s you and no there’s just me— <br />
no we no us just just just <br />
iron and <br />
lilies and <br />
coffin nails. <br />
<br />
All I want to see is darkness today. <br />
<br />
But the light keeps intruding <br />
even after the candle, snuffed by heaving breaths, <br />
snuffed enough to undo the whole legacy of definitions <br />
I’ve been trying to land on, trying to find <br />
in darkness and heat. <br />
<br />
Did you know oil has eyes? <br />
They watch when we drill through lungs <br /> 
through heart, searching <br />
arching <br />
aching in the earth. <br />
<br />
Earth full of bones and mucus. <br />
<br />
They said: find a world that never ends, <br />
a globe that never circumferences, <br />
a planet without time outside of time <br />
inside a box under a table <br />
with three legs. <br />
<br />
Listen to the drill <br />
deeper, into a hollowed-out sphere <br /> 
crafted of papier mâché <br />
but using too much glue <br />
like we always did. <br />
<br />
There’s nothing left <br />
(but lots left, covering the whole vast <br />
world) <br />
an embarrassing mess that no <br />
one <br />
wants to clean <br />
up. <br />
<br />
So I bend down <br />
and tear off a page <br />
to write on: ending lines from every corner of a circle. <br /> 
<br />
Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow <br />
faltering, wheezing, dripping <br />
over the edge, pooling off the pages <br /> 
because the glue is still wet, <br />
still sticking and dragging away my words, <br /> 
pouring over my feet. <br />
<br />
Stop. Step. <br /> 
Step two. <br />
<br />
There should have been a step one, but there isn’t. <br /> 
It was swallowed, see, no—hear—*here*, <br />
in the smallest hole you find <br />
among trembling butterfly bodies: <br />
twitch twitch <br />
itch, a scrapped memory hovering <br /> 
at the back of your eyelids, <br />
just out of reach. <br />

Step, step, step.
