I want to show you the beach <br />
that has been with me since I was in utero.<br />
Now I carry it inside me in my turn:<br />
the rocks, the barnacles with their<br />
fronds and sharp edges,<br />
the shards of bathroom tile and blackboard,<br />
the mud and grabbing kelp and broken shells,<br />
the living sand dollars and starfish and crabs.<br />
I too have sharp edges,<br />
have fronds that float in the current<br />
and reach for your ankles;<br />
I too have living things on my shores.<br />
I learned here how to hold all of this,<br />
how to lean over the water like the willow,<br />
how to grow in the cracks,<br />
like grass in the bulkhead, how<br />
to hold on like a limpet,<br />
how to come and go with the tide.<br />
I can feel your footprints in the mud inside me.<br />
They'll wash away when the tide comes in,<br />
but you'll walk here again.<br />
Water changes everything,<br />
but the rocks remember glaciers<br />
and the beach inside me will remember<br />
the shape of your toes.<br />
