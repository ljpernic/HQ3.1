The sea would flow no longer,  
      It wearied after change,  
    It called its tides and breakers in,  
      From where they might range.  

It sent an icy message  
      To every wave and rill;  
    They lagged, they paused, they stiffened,  
      They froze, and were still.  

It summoned in its currents,  
      They reached not where they led;  
    It bound its foaming whirlpools.  
      "Not the old life," it said,  

"Not fishes for the fishermen,  
      Not bold ships as before,  
    Not beating loud for ever  
      Upon the seashore,  

"But cold white foxes stepping  
      On to my hard proud breast,  
    And a bird coming sweetly  
      And building a nest.  

"My icebergs shall be mountains,  
      My silent fields of snow  
    Unmarked shall join the lands' snowfields--  
      Where, no man shall know."
