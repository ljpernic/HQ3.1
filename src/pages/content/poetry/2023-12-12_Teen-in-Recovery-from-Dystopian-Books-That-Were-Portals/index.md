<em>Teach yourself joy,</em> <br />
the therapist sings to you, white strands splitting her black hair. <br />
One paper heavier, you leave her office, <br />
contemplating the self-care list she gifted you. Cursed you with. <br />
‘Eat flowers. Be music. Make friends with beating hearts. <br />
Feel yourself m <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;v <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with patience.’ <br />

Your classmates read rom coms. You pick out all the exits <br />
in the lunch room, and sleep to your favorite lullaby— <br />

(Don’t get caught again. You will get caught again. <br />
Don’t get caught again. You might get caught again) <br />

<em>The violence is not coming home,</em> <br />
the therapist prophesizes over your head. <br />

It is enough that you know the real world is back there, <br /> 
through the books, <br /> 

where the wind weeps pitch, <br /> 
where trees gather secrets and trawl <br />

charred streets, groaning out cement, <br />
seeking the new blood they scent on you— <br />

Hyperventilate from peace, sitting in the office chair, <br /> 
when the therapist guides you visually, meditatively, through your mind <br />

like it is not just a place to plan survival, or plot sieges <br /> 
beneath The Shaken Moon, or give yourself to a lover— <br />

but&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rest. <br />
(Rest, child, this is home. You are home. <br /> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have never come home, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have you?) <br />

The quickened jelly of your mind trembles in the guided pause. <br />
You have forgotten <strong>THE PAUSE.</strong> <br /> 

<em>How</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>you</em> <br />
Your heartbeat an accusation beneath silent heating vents. <br />

The therapist chants in her melodic voice, <em>Trust, child. Trust the mind’s pause. </em> <br />
But the books taught you better. <br />

Deep beneath your feet, as your caravan slept on the Bivarious Plains, <br /> 
<strong>THE PAUSE</strong> emptied the sky. <br />

It gathered the stars—ten million shards of fire <br /> 
shooting through the ground, piercing your beloved, endlessly. <br />

More sieve than flesh your grasping fingers sank into their body. <br />
You were a pitied attempt holding together the melt of a life, splatter dripping from your cheek. <br />

Every week, hands 10 and 2, you drive a rusted car to group. <br />
Participants play musical chairs. Sometimes, they go back to what they’re good at. <br />

When she wraps you in welcome, a feeling you are not yet acclimated to, <br />
you breathe in the therapist’s perfume, the pomegranate one promising safety. <br />

It is far removed from the tang of lonely blood on battlefields. <br />
You soften, a moment. Let her enchant you, soothing music in the background. <br />  

But when you pause, you listen for empty skies. <br />
And you wait. <br />
