There’s a fierce audacity about water: <br />
the way it barges into palimpsest buildings unannounced <br />
the way the buildings are sucked into a void <br />
the way the water barrels our bodies into a concave <br />
cross-referencing us with open tombs. <br />

There are different ways to view the sea, <br />
different ways to zigzag our images on water. <br />
We can stand on the beach and watch the water <br />
clone our images into an inverse equations. <br />
Or we can dive into the water <br />

and imitate the way the sea bends its hips to the opera <br />
of high-pitched ducks and seagulls. <br />
Or just like this moment, we can sink to the spot <br />
where points and edges blossom <br />
against the fizz of water. <br />

Say, a monsoon is a blueberried photographer <br />
waiting to freeze this moment into a legacy, <br />
a striking memory, <br />
a headline on Fox News. <br />
Our eyeballs are like squeezed cranberries, red and frothy. <br />

The water is tangy and blurred with tears <br />
& somewhere, a fish recognizes a human’s face. <br />
Few seconds later, there’s the familiar fwoosh of a body <br />
swept into a canine passway. <br />
Then a gurgle. <br />
Then the loud crunch of bones. <br />

When this is over <br />
we’ll be enmeshed in a battle for names, <br />
a clamor to be known, <br />
to be called something. <br />
Every one of us will want to be seen on TV, <br />
sandbagged into ashy headlines: <br />
<u>Sixty families, now homeless.</u> <br />

And when our kids ask us to tell them <br />
where our identities are buried, <br />
our throat cells will fold <br />
into extinction. <br />

How do you describe the anatomy of loss to a child? <br />
