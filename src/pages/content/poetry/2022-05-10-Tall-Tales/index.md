<br />
The best place we ever lived <br />
had a really big tree. More than five stories <br />
shadowed the backyard. <br />
<br />
At first they were short  <br />
and simple: moralistic fables or fairy tales <br />
where the monster or witch queen <br /> 
gets what’s coming to her. <br />
<br />
As we grew, they became more complicated, <br /> 
but there was always a direction of narrative <br /> 
flow under the rough bark. <br />
<br />
Springtime was trashy romances; summer <br /> 
was for leaving home, ready to understand <br /> 
the nature of the quest. <br />
<br />
Autumn stories were about investments, <br /> 
generosity, and preparation for shortened days. <br /> 
In the fell of winter, the tree spoke <br /> 
of hidden strength, and hope. <br />
<br />
We imagined the root system <br /> 
like a whole other tree mirrored underground, <br /> 
relentlessly mining the buried past. <br />
<br />
On August nights, we perched in the highest <br /> 
branches, under the golden apple of the moon. <br />
A million possible endings <br />
rippled in the warm wind. <br />
