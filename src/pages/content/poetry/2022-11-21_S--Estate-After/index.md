The dark house sits brooding, high on the hill; <br />
heedless of time passing, of age and decay, <br />
my love walked its halls—he’s roaming them still. <br />

As spiders spin webs from windows to sills, <br />
as velvet tapestries fade and fray, <br />
the dark house sits brooding, high on the hill. <br />

Wandering from wing to wing as he willed, <br />
the lord of a land that’s wasting away, <br />
my love walked its halls—he’s roaming them still. <br />

No sunlight comes to chase away the chill <br />
that shrouds the rotting splendor night and day. <br />
The dark house sits brooding, high on the hill. <br />

There are some hearts that can never be killed; <br />
there are some spirits you can never lay. <br />
My love walked those halls—he’s roaming them still. <br />

I know neither of them will rest until <br />
the earth takes them both to share the same grave. <br />
The dark house sits brooding, high on the hill; <br />
my love walked its halls—he’s roaming them still. <br />
