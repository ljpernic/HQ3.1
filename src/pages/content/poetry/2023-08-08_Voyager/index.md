are we not nomads in this midnight sea <br />
lonely wanderers between the stars <br />
floating through dreamscape nebulae <br />
tempest tossed on gravity and tides <br />

lonely wanderers between the stars <br />
bottle messages thrown into waves <br />
tempest tossed on gravity and tides <br />
eternal drifters through inky skies <br />

bottle messages thrown into waves <br />
altered and flung out by starry death <br />
eternal drifters through inky skies <br />
transmuted by the flowing of time <br />

altered and flung out by starry death <br />
flowering into unknowable worlds <br />
transmuted by the flowing of time <br />
lives like falling star wishes flash  <br />

flowering into unknowable worlds <br />
floating through dreamscape nebulae <br />
lives like falling star wishes flash <br /> 
are we not nomads in this midnight sea <br />
