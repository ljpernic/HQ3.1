<p style="text-align: left;">The rain basks in humid slumber, whilst grandma’s roses wilt— <br />
Hearth of earth wallows in defeat <br />
and I stay lost and bare⁠— <br />
My strength died beneath the scorching siege <br /> 
and my fate wanders⁠— <br />
I pray the night for relief. <br /></p>
<p style="text-align: right;">The day is forlorn <br /> 
in the yellows, blues and reds of phantom magic⁠— <br />
I don’t know the colours of nature no more— <br />
All I see is the brown shade of its death.</p>
