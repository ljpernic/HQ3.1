the women |  <br />

they raise their voices&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the way<br />
fire raises smoke&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& the rain answers<br />  

with a flood<br />

the first rule | <br />

the first rule is to stay <br />
afloat until you become something like<br />

a boat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but <br />

the men | <br />

they ran <br />
& the water gave them new homes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&<br />

new gods & new languages etched on <br />
their tongues & a new suffering<br />

my grandfather |<br />

in his mouth there were many<br /> 
tongues&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&<br />
 
his friend |<br />

on his back there was a story<br /> 
written with the white man's whip&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&<br />       

my father |<br />

my father's taste buds are <br />
made up of English&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he first <br />

kissed me I was asleep with my eyes wide <br />
open&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& when I woke up there was <br />

I carry it like<br /> 
a flower&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a good son would carry <br />

his father's gift&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;& ever since I witnessed<br />
the river of a boy's body leaving him<br />

I've been leaning onto my thirst<br />

father |<br />

at the end of my fear there was mercy<br />        
& at the end of mercy there was a gun<br />      

when I cry it's an act of cleansing<br />
& father <br />

when |<br />

when I am bold enough<br />     
to wield a scalpel<br />

where |<br />

where  shall I begin to cleave the naked body<br />
of our suffering&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where —
