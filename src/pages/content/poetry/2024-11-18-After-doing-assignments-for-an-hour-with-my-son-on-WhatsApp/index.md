Here is a bed of downy clouds on demand, yet free to us all,<br />
next, a mouthful of sunlight to measure this blossom of late <br />
November, cornflowers, a pretty pop of blue at the corner<br />
of this end of Roundrock Road, the way to elicit care is color,<br /> 
lavish from every lawn on both sides of the street, the stillness<br />
of dew clutched inside the sweet alyssum ground cover by the door<br />
<em>unmatched for ease of care</em> said the pretty label at Walmart,<br />
to be true, I had misread it and thought it spelled seek asylum,<br />
felt the urge to put my nose into the tiny fluorescence,<br />
perhaps hug it or bite it, so as to carry its scent in the house<br />
of my lungs, the way an animal would carry its offspring in their<br />
mouth, at home I googled it and called it Sweet Alice, the flower<br />
baby I never had and would show it on my camera to my son,<br />
alyssum dulce, floare curgătoare, I explained, it seeks for a friend<br />
and he smiled, smart kid, and called me dulce, floarea mea de departe,<br />
and the smell of his soft skin filled my nostrils from the depth of <br />
the amygdala, and my dor tasted both venom and candor, and I wept.<br />
