it starts with screams in summer. <br />
there have been signs beforehand— <br />
the trees have started to refuse the rain. <br />
the sky did not submit and coated the trees, <br />
unceasing, in layers of water. <br />
water sits on the ground with open mouth, <br />
waiting to be taken by the tongues of animals, <br />
but even they refuse. the rain has stopped, <br />
and the bellies of the clouds remain filled. <br />
in the echoes of twilight, <br />
the nymphs of palm and Brazil nut trees <br />
relinquish their duties and go on strike. <br />
their hairs are nests of burning twigs. <br />
in the fear-frosted nights, unmaking is easier than making: <br />
centuries of suckered restraint finally bursting <br />
as they let go of that astonishing weight <br />
bending the willow of their neck. <br />
their inconsolable hunt is at an end. <br />
it does not take long before the Amazon is covered with ashes. <br />
the blistered bodies of broken nymphs litter the forgotten nymphs <br />
(traces of death by violence) <br />
who slowly become part of the soil. <br />
dead things live in charred lumber <br />
and sense only memories. <br />
the ash will make more life, in time— <br />
but not nymphs. <br />
never again nymphs. <br />
they have dreamed long and true <br />
in the stretch of winter, <br />
and now their essence flies skyward, <br />
at last trading their tongues for silent sisters, <br />
the last trace of their deep green irises <br />
irretrievably lost <br />
from their forsaken earth. <br />
