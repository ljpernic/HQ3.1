The earth tears at her concrete visage<br />
until she can breathe through the cracks.<br />

Listen to the viscous vows of retaliation<br />
she presses through her stuffed throats:<br />

Let the water in,<br />
she murmurs as she feels rain brushing against<br /> 
her mask of stone, begging for reunion.<br />

Let the water in,<br />
she rumbles as she remembers the gardens<br />
you pressed into matts of dead grass.<br />

You refill her claw marks with asphalt,<br />
sealing her mouths for another decade.<br />

Listen to the water’s chants<br />
echoing through overflowing sewers:<br />

Let the water in,<br />
it sings to the rhythm of rattling iron,<br />
erupting out of the darkness.<br />

Let the water in,<br />
you hear the sky howl<br />
as the water falls upon what summoned it.<br />
