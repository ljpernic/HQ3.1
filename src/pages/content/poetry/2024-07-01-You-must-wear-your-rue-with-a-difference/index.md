she makes a pond <br />
in petals pluck’d (*forget-me-*)<br />
planted in the upturn’d dirt<br />
of graves.<br />

her arms all dark,<br />
disinterred bone dust (*dancing girls*)<br />
her lungs weigh’d down<br />
with growing things.<br />

she donates her breath to butterflies<br />
& in her throat she bears (*swaddled*)<br />
chrysalises fit to burst<br />
in colors she’ll never see.<br />

on the surface of her flower pond<br />
no ducks, swans, egrets white<br />
as the bones she left uncovered—<br />
only gasping blossoms <br />

& her:

she lay herself down <br />
before poems could memorialize<br />
a virginal sacrifice (*hooker’s lips*)<br />
& parted her unkiss’d mouth<br />

& unbeckoned, sang.<br />

butterflies & moths & honeybees between her teeth<br />
their wings louder than battles & ghosts<br />
they leave in a curtain (*naked man*)<br />
& in a curtain, rain comes.<br />

her pond fills at last:<br />
petals & princesses<br />
orphans & orchids (*wax lips*)<br />
frogs & foolish love<br />

all wash away with perfume<br />
& echoes.<br />
Her soil accepts it all,<br />
seeping down to the very tips of her <br />

unbound hair.
