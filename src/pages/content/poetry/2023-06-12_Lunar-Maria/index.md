the moon doesn’t have shores <br />
it reflects waves, waits <br />
for the tide <br />

have you ever seen the sea on fire? <br />
skin propagates flame like water distorts <br />
depth <br />

five oceans burned to the ground <br />
all we ever wanted, a tree branch, <br />
to deep our feet in chlorophyll and – <br />
now, all we have is bitter salt <br />
and shuttered glass <br />

in some futures glass turns oxygen <br />
to carbon dioxide <br />
in this one, a green and blue polarity <br />
oxidizes everything we plant, <br />

if we could, we’d spit a sea <br />
on the moon, cough <br />
an oak in the dark side of our ego <br />
our bones redolent of mistakes <br />
of memories, of mosaic muscles <br />

did you know, if we fill our lungs <br />
with moondust <br />
sunlight promises to quench our thirst when <br />
our tongues turn seaweed <br />
