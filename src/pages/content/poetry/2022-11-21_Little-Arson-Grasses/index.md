If you love me, you will burn. <br />
Put your cheek against mine <br />
and feel the heat my bones  <br />
release into the world. We plant <br />
ourselves in dry soil and gather <br />
water from every deep and shallow <br />
source, and our thirst grows <br />
like the weeds between rows <br />
of corn, and the river sinks <br />
between the stones of its banks <br />
and the little arson grasses <br />
we brought from cooler climes <br />
parch and kindle, a lightning strike <br />
from inferno. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue hills rise and ripple <br />
through the smoke—I wonder <br />
how the world can breathe, imagine <br />
I smell burning, even here, miles <br />
above the conflagration. Deep valleys <br />
look almost reddish, hints <br />
of blood, of doom coiling skyward <br />
as a child screams ragged and raw <br />
in this airborne tube, the craft of men <br />
diminished against the face <br />
of destruction. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw the trees dying, <br />
years ago on a drive through <br />
miles of dry mountain passes, knew <br />
disaster could wait a little while, <br />
but probably not a lifetime. Snowpack <br />
dwindles to nothing, but even now <br />
fields of green circles spring up <br />
wherever the rugged terrain allows, <br />
as if we can’t rest until every scrap <br />
of land flinches in our grip, <br />
and we imagine ourselves gods <br />
from our vantage in the sky <br />
and not children: children <br />
in our greed and waste, infants <br />
in our understanding. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fallow lands bake <br />
under unforgiving skies. We have scraped <br />
everything we can from the surface <br />
of our world, polluted it and called <br />
it progress, but the band between it <br />
and us has stretched too tight <br />
and the snap will reverberate forever. <br />
Still, we tell ourselves the story ends <br />
differently for us, the rules erased <br />
just this one time. <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I love you, <br />
I will burn. And once I believed fire <br />
was the heart of romance, but now <br />
I wait for rain with my hands outstretched <br />
and know the story ends in ash, forever. <br />
