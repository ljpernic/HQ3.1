It took all night to get to the bottom floor <br />
under the tree roots and the cicadas and the fossils. <br />
Like anyone, I wondered if I’d found the way to Hell, <br />
but there were no screams layered like torn fabric <br />
on one another begging God’s mercy. There were no <br />
flames, no bald bodies crying, stranded across <br />
the ashen floor of an oceanless beach. There were <br />
just rows of nice couches stretching on for miles, <br />
a forest of couches, and there were people napping <br />
or just sitting and reading, talking quietly <br />
with one another. No one seemed to wonder why  <br /> 
we all were there. If I locked eyes with anyone <br />
they’d just smile a bit and nod and go back <br />
to their conversation or book. I asked a woman <br />
who was lying on a very nice futon in her <br />
work clothes with her shoes off where I was. <br />
She said, We’re under my yard. I said, No, <br />
we’re under <em>my</em> yard. She shrugged and went <br />
back to sleep. I felt bad for waking her, so <br />
I didn’t say anything more. I found a sectional <br />
no one was using, so I lay down and looked <br />
at the ceiling that was about forty feet above me, <br />
full of these white flowers everywhere, <br />
which explained the heady smell. Then I realized <br />
they were lotus flowers, that if I stayed too long, <br />
I’d forget my home and maybe never come back. <br />
I got up quickly. Does anyone know where <br />
the stairs are? I said loudly, but no one looked up. <br /> 
So I just picked a direction and walked <br />
that way for miles until a set of stairs appeared <br />
finally. I climbed them, out of the light, <br />
and when I got to the top, I was somewhere <br />
I’d never seen, with a big oak tree above me, <br />
someone else’s yard. A big dog started <br />
barking at me. But then it realized who I was <br />
and began licking my hand. What is it Brutus, <br />
said a woman from the back porch, a woman <br />
I’d never seen before. She looked <br />
at me and smiled. There you are, she said. <br /> 
I’ve been yelling for you, didn’t you hear me? <br />
She took my hand and led me inside, <br />
where I saw pictures of myself on the walls, <br />
pictures with her when we were in our twenties, <br />
pictures of us with kids at the beach. <br />
An older boy and a younger girl. Our kids? <br />
It’s dinner time, the woman said to the whole <br />
house, and we sat at the table. The kids came in <br />
and hugged me. We sat quietly, then they all <br />
looked at me and didn’t eat. Daddy? the girl said, <br />
Are you going to say the prayer? <br />
The prayer? I asked. Yeah, the one you <br /> 
always do, she said. They kept staring, staring. <br /> 
Waiting for me to start. So I cleared my throat, <br />
we held hands, and I started the prayer, which <br />
I somehow knew suddenly, every word. <br />
