waves crashing over us <br />
i said goodbye to your <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;two hands cupping a prismatic star <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;shining lighthouse bright <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;over dark, indigo waters <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;refracting on the <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;tide rising beneath our feet <br />

sea foam washing over our toes <br />
i said goodbye to your <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;two hands plunging a prismatic star <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;headlong into the ocean <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;phosphorous sparkling in the deep <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;lightning on the horizon <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;summoning me to breathe freely <br />
	
clams spitting up water and wet sand, <br />
i said goodbye to your <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;two hands lifting a prismatic star <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;through Scorpio, Jupiter, <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the Milky Way <br />


i said <br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;goodbye <br />
			
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to your hands <br />


i said <br />


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;goodbye. <br />
