The opposite of Time is Might-Have-Been.<br />
We travel through the tempered void and thus<br />
can change the stream of time to flatter us,<br />
but currents pull us toward what we’ve seen<br />
has come to pass. It lives within us still.<br />
How many restless empires have we torn<br />
down, broken, with their murderers unborn?<br />
How long do we remember who they’ve killed?<br />
How mangled have we made our histories,<br />
those scarred and damning records of events<br />
that never happened, but we can’t unsee?<br />
Our souls are trapped within biographies,<br />
and time is now the prison that prevents<br />
a world of peace, of love–of might-have-been.<br />
