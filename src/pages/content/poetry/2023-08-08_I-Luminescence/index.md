α) Radiation (This Place is a Message) <br />

What am I but an emanation <br />
Of energy better left <br />
Undisturbed, a ruined <br />
Palace calling out to you <br />
In forbidden whispers <br />
Of far-future runes? <br />

β) Bioluminescence, Beloved <br />

In the bathypelagic zone <br />
You find me through subaqueous <br />
Scrying mirrors, the lantern of my antenna— <br />
Lifeforce light—reflecting off <br />
Your diver’s suit, my villiform teeth. <br />
I won’t bite, I lie. But what I mean is: <br />
I need to know you’re real, <br />
A recollection of flesh cradled <br />
Between brittle enamel. <br />

γ) Big Bang/Chicxulub Impactor <br />

In the beginning, we were <br />
The Pillars of Creation, a mythopoetic <br />
Eagle cawing our nebular <br />
Parthenogenesis. In the beginning, <br />
Complementary colors, charged electrons, <br />
We melded into a mecha of <br />
Smoldering essence. The gods <br />
Had to separate us by black-static <br />
Lightning lest we one day <br />
Overthrew them off celestial <br />
Thrones. <br />

δ) White, Wavelength <br />

You would not believe <br />
The luminous creatures <br />
We’ve been since. <br />
