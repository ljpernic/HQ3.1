&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*Dedicated to my five-year-old self

It’s always me <br />
in my carrot cake tweed jacket <br />
its caramel collar taut around my neck <br /> 
speckled with goosebumps  <br />
pores like moon craters <br />
textured up the vase of my neck <br />
as dehydrated flowers droop out of my parted lips. <br />
It’s always her and her moon shoes <br />
her bangs quilted over her forehead <br />
her imagination quilted over her regard <br />
shelves deconstructed to a plane, <br />
she scatters museums around the matted carpet <br />
worn by pacing bare feet <br />
and it’s always us <br />
aging and curating and <br />
building trinkets up around us to a <br /> 
sky spectacle <br />
and together we hold each other <br />
behind the red curtain. <br />
Between our hands lies <br />
our bedroom <br />
children’s book pink turned sickly purple walls <br />
filling a quivering medicated spoon, <br />
woodland plushes and lava lamps, <br />
handcrafted books,  <br />
before and after photos. <br />
Between us,  <br />
there lies hope <br />
and dust. <br />
