first they called me <em>woman</em>, <br />
then <em>sorceress</em>, <br />
then <em>beast</em>. <br />

blessed in girlhood, I knew men <br />
wouldn’t love me for my magic. <br />
a woman must be a door <br />
that is always open; a space <br />
for someone else to rest in, <br />
a harvest outspread in offer. <br />

I suppose I wanted to show them <br />
my body was no place <br />
for their teeth. <br />
still: when I found the spell <br />
to change me, I hadn’t meant <br />
them harm. <br />

then I began to prefer my pelt, <br />
my huskier voice, <br />
the grind of my mandibles <br />
attuned to fear and animal heat, <br />
the scent of men <br />
who took as they pleased. <br />

one cry of a girl would send me <br />
pounding for his throat; an angel <br />
of vengeance in fur and fang. <br />
soon it didn’t take an attack <br />
to summon me. soon <br />
my beast’s desire slid into need. <br />

is instinct a crime? <br />
the Minotaur didn’t know <br />
he was a monster. he just thought <br />
he was Ariadne’s brother — <br />
born, like all of us, craving <br />
a particular kind of meat. <br />

there’s light here yet <br />
in this cell they’ve made me, <br />
and though they’ve emptied it <br />
of my books and potions <br />
they’ll never know how to pillage <br />
my mind: <br />

even now I sense the spell <br />
at my fingers; the key <br />
to release me into my truer skin — <br />
where I’ll remain, <br />
snout to the stars, <br />
laughing the wild night alive. <br />
