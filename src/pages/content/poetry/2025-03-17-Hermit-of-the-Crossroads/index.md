The hermit kneels inside his cell and prays.<br />
Here two roads meet: and at their crossing stands<br />
a sacred guard for all the kingdom’s ways.<br />

This cell, four paces square, is all his lands;<br />
four windows glimpse the freedom of the sky;<br />
four prisoning doors, he closed with his own hands.<br />

For water and for food he must rely<br />
on charity from those who walk the road.<br />
In advent of his blessing, they supply<br />

not only those few alms that he is owed,<br />
but conversation, company, and news<br />
of incidents beyond his small abode.<br />

For moments, minutes, hours they amuse<br />
the ancient hermit. Then away they trail,<br />
returning to the world that he eschews.<br />

To guardian the roads: so goes his tale,<br />
and few there are who ever comprehend<br />
how his unmoving presence can avail<br />

against all storms and perils that would rend<br />
the kingdom into many scattered parts.<br />
But in his sacred solitude thus penned,<br />
 
the hermit knows his sacrifice imparts<br />
protection, love, a sheltering, gentle spell<br />
that far surpasses all the warlike arts.<br />

Until one quiet night an unseen bell<br />
rings out, and north or west a door swings wide,<br />
as if from out this humble citadel<br />

the hermit, bent-backed, tottering, might stride.<br />
His end is near; he rises up to wait<br />
and see who from the chosen way will ride.<br />

A traveller, fated, finds the hermit’s gate<br />
has loosed its hold. His own road brings him here;<br />
he kneels to let the hermit consecrate<br />

him with a touch. Then without any tear,<br />
the hermit breathes his last. One final act:<br />
within the ground the traveller lays his peer,<br />

and under open sky and earth compact<br />
the newcomer the holy body sets.<br />
He lays one hand upon the old and cracked<br />

wood of the door, and leaving his regrets<br />
outside, he closes it. And there he stays—<br />
whoever he once was, the world forgets.<br />

The hermit kneels inside his cell and prays,<br />
a sacred guard for all the kingdom’s ways.<br />
