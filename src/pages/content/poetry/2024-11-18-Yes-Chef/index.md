My life fits inside a sentence.<br />
There aren’t any hours in any days<br />
that can’t be represented with a noun and non-fantastic <br />
verb, and maybe an adjective thrown in. Maybe icy<br />
or starving or blue or dilated. <br />
My nights are orange.<br />

This cheese grater in my hand has created enough orange<br />
zest to deserve a life sentence<br />
in the museum of me. The grand opening will be delayed because I’ll die late,<br />
lying in my coffin dazed,<br />
my families stares, the preacher stares, you stare: all icy,<br />
even a cold reception is fantastic.<br />

shake the two liter, it explodes and the kitchen floor is Fanta sticking<br /> 
to my shoes, now my soles are stained orange.<br />
This is where I keep things I want to remember. I see<br />
my middle school locker combination arguing with the living room sofa about sentience,<br />
all the poems I’ve written about daisies<br />
are laughing with the first room I ever got high in, the wallpaper is dilated.<br />

Every chef will die elated,<br />
because it’s the garnishes that make a meal fantastic.<br />
The fryer baskets in heaven are made of ivory, its been days<br />
since ive been able to scrub this orange <br />
grease off of my hands, the only thing that counts is the sentiment.<br /> 
Don’t rub the lemon twist around the rim until you’ve added ice.<br />

The frost moves like mold. Icy spores<br />
move over my eyes and nose an ears. My pupils dialate<br />
and I see nothing but fuzz and blur and haze. Is that a sentence?<br />
If not, isn’t that fantastic?<br />
The palate of my restaurant is going to be orange,<br />
with maybe a hint of lilac, like an easy day.<br />

Dry rub the lion filet with daisy <br />
petals, collect all the fire wood you see,<br />
and when the flames attract the birds and bugs, you catch them oohing,<br />
de-feather and de-leg and dehead the dialated<br />
blooms of parsley and basil, simmer and sear until fantastic.<br />
I can’t follow this recipe Chef, I need you to send hints<br />

in the orange sunsets, once the day ends<br />
make the stars whisper sentences I can’t understand, and the icy<br />
moon wink at me and maybe then I can die and believe I’m dead, it’s not fantastic.<br />
