In the small hours, under the wolf light <br />
my best friend throws peanuts <br />
at my window. It is the nymphs. <br />
They are migrating. <br />
<br />
The scorched mosaic <br />
of dirt moans under my feet. <br />
The woods are dressed in red <br /> 
but not the red they should be. <br />
<br />
too soon, too soon <br />
<br />
In my part of the world, summer is <br /> 
treacherous. They blackmailed it with <br />
cigarette butts, with stolen oils from <br />
its mother’s belly, they forced it to <br /> 
stretch—longer, hotter, suffocating <br /> 
its brothers with sweaty pillows. <br />
<br />
Autumn escaped the last moment <br />
turned into a silent thief, breath-long <br />
when there’s still air to breathe, <br />
a foreshadowing of winters harsher <br />
than your grandmother’s that catch you <br />
from behind, knife against your throat as <br />
autumn lets the reins fall at its feet. <br />
<br />
too late, too late <br />
<br />
In a primary school production <br />
my best friend played a nymph <br /> 
in a pixie haircut. We had never <br /> 
thought their hair would be shorter <br /> 
than his own but here they are, <br />
a funeral procession in blackened lungs <br />
instead of black gowns, pulling out <br />
the remains of their crisped curls as <br /> 
they lament. One sports fungus-like <br />
blisters on her cheeks, one cradles <br />
her raw arm like the baby the flames <br />
snatched away from her embrace. <br />  
<br />
Persephone, home for the summer, <br /> 
cried, not for her underworld exile <br /> 
not this time, nor for her husband’s <br />
cold breath and juicy pomegranates, <br /> 
but because her mother’s tears were not <br /> 
enough to quench the cracked earth— <br />
<br />
We wish we could tell this story but, in truth, <br />
Persephone didn’t shed a tear. They all <br />
evaporated into sweat, perhaps, or else she <br /> 
gave up on this land after the thirtieth <br /> 
black smoke factory, and resolved <br /> 
to go under earlier each year. <br />
<br />
We wish we could tell a story of <br /> 
the nymphs returning victorious <br />
but in fact, we only ever saw them <br />
leaving—pulling out crisped hair and <br /> 
dead skin, clutching a baby owl here, <br />
a battered turtle there, with homes cracked <br />
like their own. We wish we could tell <br />
a story of them going to a better place <br />
where red and yellow means autumn, <br /> 
not flames licking ancient trees. <br />
<br />
But there are no better places <br /> 
in this feverish world we inherited, <br /> 
only half melted crayons and <br />
papers with burnt edges so that <br />
we can draw new ones, <br />
only precious seeds to plant when <br /> 
scorched soil reawakens, to water with <br />
our sweat and pollinate with our rage, <br />
only stories of better places, <br /> 
green as our brightest crayon <br />
and withered <br /> 
<br />
too soon. <br />
