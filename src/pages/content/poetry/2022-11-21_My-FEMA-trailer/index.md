Early in the morning <br />
I can hear my neighbor’s TV <br />
Reverberating through the tin foil <br />
Walls of her FEMA trailer <br />
And into my own  <br />
Consciousness <br />
Lying on the paper thin mattress <br />
In my own FEMA trailer. <br />
We are together <br />
In a trailer park built <br />
On the ruins of Katrina <br />
And no matter what  <br />
They say this <br />
Formaldehyde <br />
Can’t be good <br />
But it could be worse <br />
And I know it <br />
So I’m happy this morning <br />
Listening to my neighbor’s  <br />
TV (It’s Regis and Kelly)  <br />
in my FEMA trailer  <br />
Where I can feel <br />
Every gust of wind <br />
And hear every sound <br />
Where my home <br />
Can be hitched to a truck <br />
At a moment’s notice <br />
And moved to higher ground. <br />
