when the smog finally devoured the dying sun, <br />
the creatures of the night <br />
made a throne of the carnage <br />
and a kingdom of the earth <br />
whereby a tithe of blood was imposed on survivors <br />
carefully culled and nurtured <br />
to nourish the aristocracy <br />
that neither grew nor diminished with the years <br />

its members <br />
who were present at the beginning <br /> 
and who will be present long after the end <br />
reasoned that <br />
the vampires were owed this blood <br />
for they had granted us law and order <br />
in a world beset by anarchy and chaos <br />

without them, they claimed, <br /> 
man would shed far more blood than <br /> 
what was needed to sustain this <br /> 
law and order <br />
in an uncompromising world <br />
where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain <br /> 

though revolting initially seemed our only recourse <br />
fear and doubt had been sowed among the ranks who <br /> 
reasoned that <br /> 
this revolution was not worth risking this stability <br />
that had allowed us <br /> 
a comfort <br />
unimaginable <br />
in the days of anarchy and chaos <br />

and so, our arms were relinquished <br />
our words were self-censored <br />
and life carried on <br /> 
as we had grown accustomed to <br /> 
with the years <br />

ages and ages have passed since <br /> 
and we continue to pay the tithe <br />
for that tithe was present at the beginning <br /> 
and will be present long after the end <br />
