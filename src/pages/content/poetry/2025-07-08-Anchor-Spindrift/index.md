When they carved the desk, a necessary place<br />
to keep paper from molding and aging,<br />
they cried as they stripped curves<br />

from the world. Flat surfaces repelled<br />
their sodden flesh like oil vomiting out<br />
water. A necessary compromise with<br />

land and light. To touch it was pain,<br />
so one with clever claws whittled<br />
whalebone with webbed fingers, forming<br />

the creatures of the depths, all soft swirls<br />
and terrible teeth, simple pulls for<br />
small drawers, taxonomy complexifying<br />

as they went, until they made the tripartite Lord<br />
for the centerpiece. A sealskin blotter,<br />
squid inks, scrimshaw pens, no chair needed.<br />

Built up from there, a house to keep the<br />
young in, for a time, to keep them always<br />
in sight and sound of their mother sea.<br />

The desk remained, doing its duty to keep<br />
the blessed damp from the fragile paper<br />
that said they owned this place entire,<br />

according to the law that thought it ruled<br />
the tide. When it was moved, something was lost<br />
with the gain, but there were new discoveries,<br />

a scion to bring the cousins, new tech that died<br />
in water. If it meant the papers were<br />
too far from the sea for comfort, nothing lasts<br />

against the ocean. Better they be full<br />
of new kin before the time when dead trees<br />
would cease their pretender rule. The knobs<br />

absorb the light, twist cunningly around<br />
the eye, delight the relations who come,<br />
curious, first to visit, then to stay. Not yet<br />

the new age, not the promised time when<br />
the earth will again fear the Lord and the tide.<br />
The desk has time enough to carry out<br />

the last of its purpose, to hold back the last greedy<br />
dirt until it succumbs, with all, to sand<br />
and the cubic weight of water's embrace.<br />
