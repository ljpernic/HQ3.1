Tell me the story of something ending, she said at the campfire,<br />
The story of something that tastes like vinegar<br />
And crunches like beetle shells between my teeth.<br />

He drew in a breath and thought of trivia nights and dead-eyed Zoom call stares<br />
And certifications and diplomas that meant nothing—<br />
Just ink and wood pulp, better now for kindling than anything else.<br />

She watched him as he thought of the global riots and work stoppages,<br />
The trashing of corporate offices and the liberation of the sweatshops,<br />
How we pulled the statues down. We’d been so desperate and hopeful,<br />

But it all had been too late.<br />

The fascists still held their fiefdoms and the environment<br />
Was collapsing, unrecoverable. The floods couldn’t douse the wildfires,<br />
And the billionaire oligarchs had already escaped to Mars.<br />

He looked at her and said, I’ll tell you the story<br />
Of raindrops that drum and rattle on the rust<br />
Of ancient trailer parks and dead satellite dishes.<br />

And I’ll tell you the story of the leftover souls that glow<br />
Like the flashbulb afterburns, distant and fading images,<br />
Lonely as whale songs in the deep.<br />

I’ll tell you a story, he said, of Twenty-First Century life,<br />
Of holding on too long to the things we should have let go of,  <br />
For we were frozen; surely there were worst years than these.<br />

I’ll tell you my stories if you tell me yours, he said,<br />
How you made it through all this and found your way to me.<br />
