The atmosphere is breaking. <br />

A puddle stands in the <br />
middle of the street, reflecting <br /> 
all our cracked <br />
and rotting dreams. <br />

Two bubbles, slick and oily. <br />

Two men watch <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One building folds in on itself <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;a collapsing ampersand, <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;frog base <br />

Its last breath is red brick dust. <br />

Grey suit One. Yellow tie Two. <br />
Both are balding, both are giving up. <br />
between their feet, the road cracks <br />
and flakes away <br />
a cheap manicure <br />
(an expensive earthquake). <br />

First street&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Empty</em> <br />
Favorite dies in a pile of onion skins. <br />
We all peel <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;away from ourselves <br />
in oil <br />
and tears. <br />

Yesterday the clouds were in the sky. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today he’s on the ground, collecting <br /> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the pieces of a pair of broken <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;glasses. <br />

Chips break <br />
skin, but she scratched <br />
out the corners of his lungs <br />
already. <br />
A puddle of cooling machine oil accepts <br />
his blood. <br />

Rogue brick escapes the tangles <br />
of his tumbling house, <br />
catches a man in the <br />
inner <br />
ear. <br />

Fragile globe shatters, spewing grey across a fallen sky. <br />
One bubble remains. <br />
