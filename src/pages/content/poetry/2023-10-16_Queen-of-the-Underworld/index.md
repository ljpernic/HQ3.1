When I float along the deep abyss, every rotting worm writhes <br />
to be near me, every putrid parasite begs <br /> 
for me to eat him whole. The School of Worship <br /> 
comes out from hiding, longing for salvation <br /> 
in my generous arms, and in the Midnight Mass, <br /> 
the angler’s lure is dimmed by my dazzling spring. <br /> 
They say I was stolen from my home, coveted and preyed <br /> 
upon by my own, but blithely I traverse the land of monsters <br /> 
and mayhem, having long forgotten the Ionian Sea. <br /> 
First appeared the Unseen One, then arrived the gods from above, <br />
all pining for my blue blood heart, and because I have three <br />
I danced for them, lone and ephemeral, <br />
watching and learning before vanishing spectral, <br />
to continue onward, downward, into the hadal, <br />
unfettered, untraceable—no ink left <br />
to write home, anyhow. For I am no longer merely a maiden, <br /> 
a benevolent creature once dreamed; I am the goddess of life, <br />
of death and destruction— <br />
the sojourning Underworld Queen. <br />
