I run out of ways to keep you urgent in my mouth, <br />
stomach your shouting relic. <br />
so, when grief comes for an unburial, unearthing you into the forgotten, <br />
I stuff you under my tongue. <br />

how I've learnt to carry you across borders, <br />
across turnpikes & racial diss. <br />
across the panting roadblocks, <br /> 
where we exist loudly as exclamations below a cop's knee, <br /> 
or viscous ransack that gets close but doesn't claim my throat. <br />

the near miss—a hurt we alone can voice. <br />

I scale you across walls, unpronounced. <br />
pawn all my sound rates at eager cost, to house your absence. <br />
the mold of your breath: a memory of all the things we run out of. <br />
till I approach the wild reserve of oxygen & grim soil yawning to mouth you <br />
whose hunger surrounds a place, kills its aura <br /> 
knowing an opening isn't reception. <br />

you go by the names of every fattened contraband, <br />
nurtured by my silence, <br />
plump with a knowing of all I've held back. <br />

I genuflect, teeth heavy into dust <br /> 
to sow your person in a sullied language. <br />
I drown your absence deep in the carnivorous mud: <br />
a wreckful planting of small pockets of thirst. <br />

the sky—grief hefty. <br />
wrathful cherubs, laced in giant heaps of puffed cloud. <br />
each turn, a weeping threat. <br />

I howl into wetness till the ground goes soft, <br />
loamy with my passing breath & the trail of your absence I indent with shrubs. <br />
each thicket, a bleed and scything remark scribbled in furious red <br />
across the tiny mouths of the world <br />

as I hold you urgent, behind clenched lips. <br />
a sharp susurration tilling its underbrush. <br />

how likely we assume dust, <br />
by which I mean slit our tongue into sones & decibels. <br />
a throbbing loudness seething from within: <br />
an hour of sobbing gold. <br />
