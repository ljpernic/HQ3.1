bedtime is the worst <br />
mama off giggling and cooing <br />
with her latest boyfriend <br />

me sent to my room <br />
ordered not to come out <br />

the thing beneath my bed <br />
oozes out and wants to talk <br />
about stupid stuff like <br />
what I learned at school <br />
what I watched on TV <br />
how I should do my hair <br />

I tell it to shut up <br />
and go away <br />
'cause I'm not gonna <br />
do up my hair all fancy <br />
or wear frilly dresses <br />
I'm gonna be me <br />

the monster always whines <br />
that it's ancient <br />
it's been living in kids' rooms <br />
for centuries <br />
that it knows what's best <br />

and I tell that oozing green thing <br />
that it doesn't know nothing <br />
being old doesn't make it smart <br />
or right <br />
it just makes it old <br />

that usually shuts it up <br />
so I can finally fall asleep <br />
