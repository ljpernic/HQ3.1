As she’s borne softly on the waves, <br /> 
salt hangs aloft, brining her lips. <br />
Palm trees sway on nearby shores, <br />
but unease gathers in her heart.<br />
It’s paradise, yet she’ll not forget: <br />
her home feels like it’s not enough. <br />

That constant whisper, “Not enough.” <br />
Yet there’s no answer on the waves. <br />
It makes her want to leave, forget. <br />
‘Til kindness from her sisters’ lips <br />
slows her ever-yearning heart. <br />
But it still beats for other shores. <br />

So one day she leaves, toward the shores, <br />
to find something to be enough. <br />
She sees <em>him</em>. Her wretched heart, <br />
it swells; she lifts herself above the waves. <br />
All her focus on his sultry lips, <br />
his handsome brow makes her forget. <br />

Away from home, all else she will forget. <br />
It will be better on the shores. <br />
Magic sparks when lips meet lips. <br />
And maybe, maybe, it’s enough. <br />
But he brings <em>others</em> on the waves; <br />
they cage her and her broken heart. <br />

Now there’s nothing in her heart. <br />
But her sisters, <em>they</em> did not forget. <br />
They come to her upon the waves, <br />
smash her prison, climb to the shores, <br />
and make a meal of it. Plenty enough, <br />
as blood drips from their fangs and lips. <br />

“I’m sorry,” slips from her disloyal lips. <br />
She leaves, cradling her shattered heart, <br />
accepting that nothing will be enough. <br />
She’ll be alone now; try her best to forget. <br />
But her sisters, they take her home, from these shores. <br />
Dripping blood, they descend into the waves. <br />

While her lips may never forget, <br />
her heart no longer dreams of distant shores. <br />
The sea and the waves, they are enough. <br />
