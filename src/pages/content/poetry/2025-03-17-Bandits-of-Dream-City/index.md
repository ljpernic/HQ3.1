In my dreams, we’re burglars

Our fingers ooze through castle walls of toffee and cloud<br />
like a warmed spoon through the toffee-walnut ice-cream I churned on your birthday

Our breath steals between the gaps in a snake-streusel door<br />
like the entire rhubarb-streusel pie you snuck into that terrifying French documentary 

We dodge cardamom-bullets screaming out of paneer-dragon mouths<br />
like the recipe my mother frothed out over the phone, too pungent for your sister

We whisper past treasures of diamond-sugar and pearl-milk <br />
like—<br />
like—

Your text scalds me awake,<br /> 
as warm and painfully bright as bedroom sunshine

<p style="text-align: center;"> <em>
Been a while!<br />
How’s it going?<br />
You doing okay?
</em></p>

You don’t remember the heists we dreamed.<br />
I don’t remember the taste of your kiss.
