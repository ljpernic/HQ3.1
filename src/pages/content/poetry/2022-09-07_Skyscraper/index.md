I was thinking today of a<br />
world without traffic lights<br />
where pushing the button<br />
on the dashboard for recirculated air<br />
would send the carbon dioxide<br />
we breathe out from the cabin<br />
into a special compartment full<br />
of plants and the compartment would<br />
be open to let in the sun but<br />
shielded to protect it from wind and<br />
the plants would photosynthesize<br />
the carbon dioxide and release<br />
oxygen that would be piped back<br />
into the car, which, come to think of it,<br />
would probably be solar powered<br />
and in the world where<br />
this car exists there would be<br />
a skyscraper where all the people<br />
live, high up in the clouds,<br />
and everywhere else would be<br />
parks.<br />
