do not forget to drag your feet, my darling, <br />
for the road is long and the trees cannot protect you here <br />
and though their hands may urge you forward <br /> 
look behind, <br /> 
into the whites of their eyes and the grit in their beards <br /> 
remember, seasons like winter were made to be suffered <br /> 
and it is hard to recognize the curl of spring through a darkening sky <br /> 

changeling child, once-darling-one, remember <br /> 
that though you may not know your way through shadow, <br />
it has felt your toes in its leaf-covered carpet, <br /> 
the shuffle of tiny feet in its mires, and it may allow you back <br /> 
because of this <br /> 

they made their deals a year ago <br /> 
you think, though time is strange and dry out on the road, <br />
they nodded solemnly, divided spoils amongst themselves like <br /> 
they might not eat again for weeks, but <br /> 

you were trained for this, my darling, <br /> 
you were gentle tendrils on the wind and peaking eyes through riverbeds <br />
you were swampland grass that rattled untrained steps without a warning <br /> 
you were handed over, <br /> 
little bodies, little hands and bowstring fingers <br /> 

you were walking before you even learned their names <br /> 

do not forget to drag your feet. remember <br /> 
when you became the mud around a cool brown river, <br />
sink back into the ground and blunt your heels on stone, <br /> 
raise your small voice to the moon, gnash your pointed teeth, and pray <br />
you never reach the market. <br />
