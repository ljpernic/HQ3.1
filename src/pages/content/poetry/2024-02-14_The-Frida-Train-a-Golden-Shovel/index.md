“Pies, para qué los quiero si tengo alas para volar?”*<br />
― Frida Kahlo (1907–1954)<br />

The blueprint was hidden under Frida Kahlo's bed, where she rested her feet,<br />
after the accident. Engineers puzzled over the design, knowing not what<br />
it was for, but built her hand-drawn estaciones to learn what they could do<br />
100 years after her death in 1954. Standing by one street corner booth, I<br />
remember watching people with no legs or with no arms and people in need<br />
of a lift drift into Mexico City skies as an unseen airstream carried them<br />
wherever they wished to go. This elevated transit system was created for<br />
passengers with disabilities, who describe the ride as a spiritual experience. If<br />
any unqualified soul chose to enter one of her estaciones they would be, as I<br />
was, startled by the artist herself, hair on fire and smirking lips that have<br />
blood dripping as she utters: “Espero que nunca vuelvas.” These sacred wings<br />
belong to those who know the shape of transcendence, who endure and endure to<br />
catch the Frida Train when life collides with life, who figured out how to fly.<br />

*“Feet, what do I need them for if I have wings to fly?”<br />
