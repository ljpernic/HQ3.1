    the cables and cord extensions stretched out like the markings of where a round table would be. <br />

    The no ending, unending, infinite: the sense of loss; <br />
    warm metal carrying the intermittent ticking of the electric surges, Excalibur without its scabbard <br />"

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It's in pieces: the mind, the Kleenex box with torn openings, <br /> 
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;the cables and cord extensions stretched out like the markings of where a round table would be. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The no ending, unending, infinite: the sense of loss; <br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;warm metal carrying the intermittent ticking of the electric surges, Excalibur without its scabbard <br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this is an old place with the hummingbird flimsy red plastic feeder swinging from the balcony two-steps from disintegration. No castle, no crown. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;His mind goes: void, spark, frisson—a supernova born consciousness within the roots of jacaranda trees, violet blooms turning mulberry under the clouded sky. <br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Kingdom has come knocking before the past has finished calcifying in the recesses of his heart. Hope rises, sleepy-eyed and says <br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;this world needs him, with his dry hair still scented from centuries-old shampoo, to survive. Awake, half-hoping the tea-burnt tongue is not too thick to swallow <br />

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Choked-off grief, choked-off fear. Merlin's silhouette devouring each and every doubt. Beyond the door they wait. <br />
