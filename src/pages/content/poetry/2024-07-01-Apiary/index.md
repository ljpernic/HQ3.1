We start first with the honeycombs <br />
as babies, slipping whole past <br />
our gummy mouths and tiny throats. <br />
The sepsis is our insides preparing us <br />
for the life ahead. <br />

When our tiny bodies spasm & still, <br />
we are weaned on ichor & ambrosia. <br />
Six drops on our swollen tongues, <br />
so we teeter always on the edge <br />
of deathless & dying, so the engine of our bodies <br />
might remember the taste, <br />
hold the ghost of it until we are culled <br /> 
to produce. <br />

I remember my first bee, <br />
thrumming past my lips like a song, <br />
bruising itself senseless <br />
against the supple sanctum of my mouth <br />
until dazed & urged on by the wave of saliva, <br />
slunk down my throat. <br />

My bee was my first friend, it’s confused, <br />
constant buzzing a secret language <br />
only I understood, it’s steady thrumming <br />
a lullaby. <br />

We apiarists are a lonely bunch – <br />
sequestered since infancy <br />
from others who might steal <br />
our focus, feed us <br />
lies of a different life. <br /> 

Bee after bee I did my duty. <br />
& at my ceremony did my veins not seep amber, <br />
molasses slow? & every year since <br />
until there is nothing <br />
to give. <br />

When I die they will rise <br />
from my throat like a horde <br />
of flies and suffocate at their first taste <br />
of air, fluttering down <br />
to paint my corpse a pietá. <br />

Blessed are we who do the holy work <br />
of hell. Blessed are our stung insides <br />
& bleeding mouths. All that swallowed <br />
blood that makes a river in our bellies. <br />
& our dry, desert veins & dessicated <br />
hearts spouting sand from all its holes. <br />

Blessed are we the beekeepers <br />
seated at the right hand of gods & the left <br />
hand of demons. Blessed is our suffering. <br />
Blessed is our sacrifice. <br />
