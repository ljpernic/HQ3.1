You’ve written your last words; you will not speak them<br />
His spell would not let you, anyway<br />
Not now; after years of wielding tiny pins—<br />
too small for dancing angels—<br />
he ruptures your vocal cords, tearing (through)<br />
Only a croak escaping<br />

You offer this croak to the sea witch; you’ve nothing else to barter<br />
You’d given it all to him. Anyway.<br />
Not now, but before, your voice was mesmerizing—<br />
too large for one body to contain—<br />
she shakes her heavy head, tearing (up)<br />
Salty lips finding yours<br />

You’d expected an end; you receive a beginning<br />
Or the potential for one, anyway<br />
For now, during your darkest moment—<br />
too intimate to remain unshared—<br />
you recognize your power, tearing (away)<br />
Only your last words remaining<br />

You’ve created your own space; you refuse to hide in it<br />
He will not find you anyway<br />
Not now; he can’t fathom your existence in time—<br />
too entangled to separate your past from her future—<br />
you clasp each other tight and run, tearing (by)<br />
World and word blurring<br />
