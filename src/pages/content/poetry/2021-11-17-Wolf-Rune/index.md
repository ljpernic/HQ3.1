The forest lands link earth with heaven,<br />
spruce-tree tips like dendrites of elder earthen gods.<br />

The long, dark, lonely winters swirl within<br />
a song, the singer’s storm-tossed mind at odds<br />
with frozen lakes, the fir trees’ needle-bed.<br />

Moose-haunted evergreens stretch miles and miles,<br />
and fallow fields will waken with the red<br />
and purple flowers of the spring. The wiles<br />

of ancient wolves weave through the singer’s song,<br />
the howls primeval, blood-bonds mingling, strong.<br />
<br />
