I will paint you a sign, rumseller,  
         And hang it above your door;  
    A truer and better signboard  
         Than ever you had before.  
    I will paint with the skill of a master,  
         And many shall pause to see  
    This wonderful piece of painting,  
         So like the reality.  

I will paint yourself, rumseller,  
         As you wait for that fair young boy,  
    Just in the morning of manhood,  
         A mother's pride and joy.  
    He has no thought of stopping,  
         But you greet him with a smile,  
    And you seem so blithe and friendly,  
         That he pauses to chat awhile.  

I will paint you again, rumseller,  
         I will paint you as you stand,  
    With a foaming glass of liquor  
         Extended in your hand.  
    He wavers, but you urge him -  
         Drink, pledge me just this one!  
    And he takes the glass and drains it,  
         And the hellish work is done.  

And next I will paint a drunkard -  
         Only a year has flown,  
    But into that loathsome creature  
         The fair young boy has grown.  
    The work was sure and rapid.  
         I will paint him as he lies  
    In a torpid, drunken slumber,  
         Under the wintry skies.  

I will paint the form of the mother  
         As she kneels at her darling's side,  
    Her beautiful boy that was dearer  
         Than all the world beside.  
    I will paint the shape of a coffin,  
         Labelled with one word - "Lost"  
    I will paint all this, rumseller,  
         And will paint it free of cost.  

The sin and the shame and the sorrow,  
         The crime and the want and the woe  
    That are born there in your workshop,  
         No hand can paint, you know.  
    But I'll paint you a sign, rumseller,  
         And many shall pause to view  
    This wonderful swinging signboard,  
         So terribly, fearfully true.
