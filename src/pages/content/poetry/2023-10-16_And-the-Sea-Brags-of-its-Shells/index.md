When I wake, it’s to hear the last siren, <br />
receding to its distant causeway, banks of <br />
salt, their bygone shackles of sand. <br />

I hear, <em>dig out what calls to you down</em> <br />
<em>to an aragonite shore—stay gentle, as</em> <br />
<em>you clean away the remains of so many</em> <br />

<em>broken plates; the profound struggles</em> <br />
<em>of timid fossils.</em> See? Here’s a boundary <br />
of long, but permanent, staycations. <br />

“Exhume,” is too strong a word; but to <br />
recover such monitions and portents, laving, <br />
as they do, to teem over shorelines of dreaming, <br />

his fingers—<em>your fingers, I’ll sigh</em>—are what dig <br />
to me; inquire behind an exhale of foam. You may <br />
recognize the body—it’s as polite now as a hand- <br />

washed sweater. It was never necessary to wear it. <br />
I know. He was a listener. Presume that I will lift him <br />
from under the chalk of his frame—he’s not going <br />

anywhere, fast. You can see, his ears are scoured- <br />
out by sand. There’s nothing between my hands <br />
and his. Not a slick of silence. Stay confident, <br />

and whisper: <em>I love this shore that drew</em> <br />
<em>your feet to me; washed your shoulders;</em> <br />
<em>beached your raft of bones.</em> You’ve been <br />

safe, undercover, my love. I knew we’d run-in <br />
this way, together—no question. I’m afraid that <br />
—in moving toward this finish line—I’m inevitable. <br />
