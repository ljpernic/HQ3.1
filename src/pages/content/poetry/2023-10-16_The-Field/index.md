Beyond the boundaries of my yard, <br />
water flows through furrows in a field,  <br />
harvested and fallow now, where corn waved <br /> 
and last year's winter wheat greened the ground <br />
through all the cold brown barren time. <br />

Beneath that soil, I believe, an olden lake— <br />
not a molten core—comes and goes. <br /> 

I've seen that lake, parceled in puddles <br />				
by earth, each raindrop remembering <br /> 
higher seas, inundation—rising <br />
in pools one wound at a time— <br />
flooding the land <br /> 
in ancient bottomless grief. <br />
