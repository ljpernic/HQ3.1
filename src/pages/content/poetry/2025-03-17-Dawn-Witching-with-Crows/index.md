Softly lift the tools of your secret witching. <br />
Make no noise your mothers will hear, no telltale <br />
scrape of knife on stone; keep your setup silent. <br />
Answer no questions. 

Birds will sing these songs with you–meet them, trill for<br />
cry. Then, under daybreak blue morning quiet,<br />
hand your tools to birds. See how quickly crows learn<br />
witching with women.

Knives in birds' claws, knives scraping sharp-edged secrets–<br />
feel the heavy pleasure of being tied to<br />
crows, who know more witchcraft than humans; still they<br />
wait for us, cackling.

Cast your spells in whistles, in lines cut deep in<br />
wood, in feathers taken from willing birds, who,<br />
loyal comrades, hide these small witchings, singing.<br />
Birdsong keeps secrets.

Day comes swiftly, wakes all the sleeping, hungry,<br />
bringing pains and mundane cares. Put your tools in<br />
safer places. Crows with your knives, if seen, are<br />
dangerous. Thank them.
