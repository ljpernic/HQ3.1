The burning comes earlier <br />
and earlier each year, as we march <br />
our way further down this angry path. <br />
Seems I can recall passes <br />
round the sun where snow <br />
still fell in great heaping drifts <br />
from the sky well into March. <br />
Seems I can recall the time <br />
when we cheered <br />
at the thick smoke rising into the sky. <br />

I know I remember old Lilike <br />
left alone and freezing <br />
in folds of tattered blankets. <br />
Karel was the one to find her. <br />
Her only son returned, <br />
greeted with a cold hearth <br />
and an empty, pallid grin. <br />
We wailed into the night <br />
until her name and Marzanna's <br /> 
melded into a slurry <br />
of incomprehensible syllables. <br />

Now, our voices warble <br />
for something new entire. <br />
In shorts and sunscreen <br />
at the wrong solstice, we weep <br /> 
and scream for Marzanna slipping, <br />
slick like oil between our fingers, <br />
into the nothingness of history. <br />
Effigies don't burn so well <br />
in this overflow but we can all <br />
duck our heads deep in the runoff <br />
and bid the terror farewell. <br />
