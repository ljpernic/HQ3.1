Gods writ microscopic, <br />
we are the children of extremes <br /> 
chitin-clothed, long-dead spores enduring still, <br /> 
ghosts of ghosts <br />
a billion years dead <br />

For millennia, <br /> 
we collected your buried tribute <br /> 
flesh, blood, bones <br />
plastics, garbage, toxic sludge <br />
every sacrifice you unknowingly gave <br />

Now, we emerge from melting permafrost <br />
from chthonic darkness <br />
from fossilized decay <br />

We are the plural gods of Tartarus, <br />
heralds of humanity’s end, <br />
and our hungry spores will root <br /> 
in your soft and sinful flesh <br />
