Last night, I was in a grim, dusty, subdued Poland, <br />
like a modern theatrical production imagining medieval gloom, <br />
bleached palette, pre-industrial quiet, charred air. <br />

Mud-covered bodies stumble larger towards me <br />
aimlessly with insects, despair, <br />
Ewa appears: their homes bombed, <br />
bakeries breadless, our hunger is appropriate emptiness, <br />
electricity is out, but what utility is a grid while everything dissembles? <br /> 

Her impassive mien voids her words’ explanation, it is senseless. <br /> 
I scan the wrecked skyline for a town center, <br />
to head away, looking for my love. <br />

I think I see her at the very limit of my vision, <br />
emerging from a forest. <br />
Three streets closer, traversed in silent time distortion of <br />
film reeled out 8 frames per second, <br />
I see it is not her. <br />

An injured dog balanced on a bridge railing <br />
gives the impression of her. <br />
I cannot breathe deeply enough to <br />
dispel fearful distress, <br />
and wake. <br />
