    Mountain pine so unholy<br />
    Speak of limb rot, dank rain fungus<br />
    Speak of barren lands, absent birds<br />
    No beak nor burrow to sow seeds<br />
    Of drought that parches to the root<br />
    Speak of gale force destruction<br />'

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Merlin furious, fell, can no longer</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>abide deciduous, conifer, any bark</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>limbed being ever since his confinement</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>he has yet to feel, will stop at any cost</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>to halt future’s relentless, unwinding cord</em><br />

Speak of fires, infestations<br />
Mountain pine so unholy<br />
Speak of limb rot, dank rain fungus<br />
Speak of barren lands, absent birds<br />
No beak nor burrow to sow seeds<br />
Of drought that parches to the root<br />
Speak of gale force destruction<br />

Sow contamination, the might of backhoes<br />
Drill holes, piss gasoline, set bushfires<br />
Hammer copper nails till blood-sap runs<br />
Relish flattening the cracking fallen leaves<br />

Stand with axe and hatchet <br />
Give forth the mighty roar of chainsaw<br />
Proclaim: There are no dryads here! <br />
Three times each, enact these charms<br />
To raze the forest whole of which I dream<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Dryads, thin as ferny fronds bend</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>don’t break from fearsome spellbinding</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>plead the earth's green flowing veins</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>know floral time is slow acceptance</em><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em>sing a song of verdant rebirth</em><br />

Speak of the sky’s cerulean silk<br />
Under sun’s umbrella, the whispery breeze <br />
Speak of pinecones shepherded to seed <br />
Speak of owls, bats and chickadees<br />
Sure to scour the insect’s worrying bite<br />
Speak of rabbit, deer and swift vole’s homes<br />
Bolster bark’s continual power to repel <br />

Nurture foliate leaves, knotted scars<br />
Signs of each tree’s struggle to new summits<br />
See luxuriant shadows and chlorophyll play <br />
Here, dryads dance, sway pliable limbs <br />

Bring on the cooling balm of rain’s tears<br />
Listen to the creak and rustle, sylvan movement<br />
These are ways to raise a tree, prune its boughs<br />
Pluck sweet bounty, give it room to breathe <br />

Think, more than three, through eternity<br />
Such rough-branched idols bring fertility<br />
Shelter from shower or scalding solar watch <br />

Over all your years of work or long ensorcelled sleep<br />
Until your end or ours, these trees stand<br />
Guard for you and we<br />
Always give their very breath<br />
So we may breathe<br />
