the air smells of brine and night spirits <br />
of bare feet sinking into the orchard’s dark earth<br />
where pink ladies dream standing upright <br />
their old branches like my withered arms <br />
and the sea of green I can’t see in the failing light <br />
dark waves of bluegrass and mason jars filled with fireflies <br />

this is the scented memory of a sealed off childhood <br />
a soda-lime bottle poured out to the last teardrop <br />

white petals brush against time-gnarled scars <br />
the apple trees sigh and creak and shiver <br />
their wood hearts dreaming of being carved into ships <br />
and sailing into the dusky emerald <br />

the world shatters a child as easily as colored glass <br />
and only what doesn’t break remains <br />

the days have grown shorter, the nights longer <br />
as the night spirits descend all around me <br />
some pretend to be pale leaves that sway in the wind <br />
others stare back while wearing faces I know <br />
like so many dew drops trapped in a spider's web <br />
and one is a girl I once was, shedding bark-lined skin <br />

she touches my hand before wading into that sea of green <br />
the currents promising a shore without yesterdays <br />
