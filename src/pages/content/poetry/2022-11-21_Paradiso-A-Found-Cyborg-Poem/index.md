*(taken from 2020s advertisements)* <br />

it’s *written in the stars*:  <br />
the ingeniously simple  <br />
magnetic mechanism  <br />
of the making process — <br />
a depth of field  <br />
stitching together  <br />
trees, mythology — <br />
cosmic archetypes <br />
adjustable and buzzing. <br />

the orchestra of the future <br />
emerges through dream <br />
in underlying ontological <br />
ritual: digital axiological  <br />
alchemy. <br />

life buzzes versatile: <br />
a soul-making practice of <br />
inner landscape where <br />
a celebration <br />
of paradise <br />
blooms — <br />
