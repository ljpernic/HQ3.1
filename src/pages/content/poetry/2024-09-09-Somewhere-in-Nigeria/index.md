<p style="text-align: right;">Somewhere in Nigeria: in Lokoja, Lagos,<br />
Somewhere in Abia, Adamawa, Anambra,<br />
some houses have become dams.<br />
People have become Hagfish.<br />
Roads have turned to rivers. <br />
Cyborgs are yet to learn how to <br />
become fish & swim. Somewhere<br />
in Kwara, water has –once again– <br /> 
blew another bright flame of <br />
some families into oblivion.<br /></p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Somewhere, a boy was seeking a cup of water. He was given an ocean.<br /> 
Question:-<br />
           what is the gravity of the boy &<br />
          the cup, in the tides of the ocean?<br />
Answer:-<br />
       The boy's weight:- {7kg}<br />
       The cup's weight:- {0.2kg}<br />
       A goddess tree:- {1000kg}<br />
       A log of tree:- {50kg}<br />
      Weight of the boy & the cup:- {7.2kg}<br />
The truth is, rainfall once turned a goddess<br />
tree to logs, & an ocean streamed them.<br />
Therefore, the gravity of the boy & the cup<br />
in the tides of the ocean is the weight of<br />
a paper in the arms of the wind— {}.<br /></p>

<p style="text-align: right;">Here, we're birds with wings;<br /> 
we only know to fly, not to develop gills, <br />
not to become fish, not to swim. &<br />
Rainfalls are protesting; <br />
They're aiming the throats of houses &<br />
Deforestation is disfiguring the land—<br />
Land is becoming a tissue paper.<br />
The climate change is teaching cyborgs<br />
how to shutdown— float! float! float!<br />
I wonder how much flowers our minds<br />
have collected to stream them with?<br />
How much more will we collect?<br />
How much longer will we be the collectors?.<br /></p>
