I. <br />
Last summer I buried a body under the apple tree <br />
and every now and then I see the ghost plucking weeds <br />
and picking seeds from his teeth. <br />
He spits them at my window at night. <br />

He says he’s tired of eating rotten fruit; <br />
he wants to know what it is like to hold something <br />
without it being bruised—slick <br /> 
and black. The creatures that crawl <br />
into his mouth at night <br />
are dense, and I hear him <br /> 
choke in his sleep, <br />
like an owl on the bones <br />
of its prey. <br />
<br />
“Your heart is too ripe to eat,” he tells me, <br />
but goes looking under roots and beds <br />
to find something sweeter instead. He doesn’t know <br />
that longing is a greedy thing, <br />
and it will grow sour in his sleeping veins. <br />
The beast it will make of him <br /> 
will crave roses and ruin alike. <br />
But what grows in the garden <br /> 
of a dead man’s heart <br />
can only rot. <br />
<br />
He groans at night, under the tree, spinning in his grave <br />
I hear him cry out in the dark, <br />
*Tell me, why am I always starving?* <br />
 <br />
II. <br />
I found him in the kitchen one morning, <br />
green hands clutching fistfuls of glass, <br />
lips specked with sugar. <br /> 
Every sunrise since, he finds a way inside <br />
to rummage through each shelf and drawer, <br />
clearing cabinets and swallowing <br />
jars of syrup whole. <br />
Day and night, he gorges and grows, <br /> 
until he is no longer a man at all. <br />
<br />
He forgets how to speak one evening. <br />
Black sap drips from his mouth <br />
and pools in the cracks of the wooden floor. <br />
Flies circle round his head, crawl in his ears <br />
but he does not notice them. <br /> 
He only eats some more. <br />
<br />
When toadstools sprout from his eyes, I lock the doors. <br />
But he breaks the frame with curling weeds, <br />
and stones from his moss-mottled hands. <br /> 
Bees swarm, and the house is fallen, painted, <br />
honey-sweet and sick. <br /> 
<br />
I beg him to leave. I say there’s nothing left. <br />
He cannot reply, but I know his answer. <br />
I see it in the spiders and maggots and worms, <br />
*What else is there for the dead to eat, but the living?* <br />
<br />
III. <br />
I set a feast one night, <br />
the table laid with berries, wine and apples from his tree. <br />
He climbs out of the dirt, through the doorway, and gazes <br />
down at me from that ill-fitted skin. <br />
I can almost hear the soul behind the decay, <br />
a flytrap of a man, lost to his hunger. <br />
<br />
I sit across from him, and watch <br />
as the red rolls down his chin, staining the shirt <br /> 
I buried him in. When he skulks back to sleep, <br />
I fetch a shovel and an ax <br />
and I follow him to the garden gate. <br />
<br />
He sinks down deep, dragged under in the fleeting hands <br />
of a sugary haze. Curled in a blanket of roots. <br />
<br />
First, I cut down the tree. The limbs moan and scratch at my arms, <br />
fruit falls like hail, rotting, rolling into his grave. <br /> 
A while after, I stare down at him asleep <br />
a withered child in a tainted womb <br />
and I climb in over him. I kneel atop the mud and take the ax <br />
to his throat. Syrup spills onto my hands and I finally find his heart— <br />
a chrysalis. <br />
<br />
I don’t remember what flew out of his chest, only that it smelled <br />
of rain, when I peeled the roots from around it <br />
and that it was light. <br /> 
Every earthen thing about him died then, <br />
wilted away like old paint on stone <br />
and left behind the man I once called to from the window. <br />
<br />
I kissed his lifeless face, placed a marigold in his pocket <br />
and piled the dirt upon him until dawn bloomed on the horizon. <br />
He rests under a new garden now, and the roses bloom their reddest <br />
right atop his tomb. Wild raspberries grow where the tree stood. <br />
Every summer, I leave some behind after picking <br />
and in the sunset’s glow, I see him still, smiling <br />
and licking nectar from his fingertips. <br />
