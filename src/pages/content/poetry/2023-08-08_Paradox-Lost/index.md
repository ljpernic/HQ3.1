<p style="text-align: right;"><em>A dismal universal hiss, the sound</em> <br />
<em>Of public scorn; he wonder’d…</em> </p>

bio Grandfather with a shotgun <br />
caught me in the loft of the barn <br />
two clicks removed from levitical codes <br />

chaos of slurs and bullets <br />
chorus of curses <br />
<em>NO, No, no – no, No, NO</em> <br />

I <br /> 
was sent to the hospital <br />
my love was not <br />

*** <br />
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Som natural tears they drop'd, </em> <br /> 
<em>but wip'd them soon…</em> </p>

*** <br />
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n…</em> </p>

decades removed from the incident <br />
I founded Tempus Reciprocat Labs <br />
as product of genius, of therapy, of long con <br />

on the first day <br />
I created the prototype for a time machine coil <br />
that was fierce in its elegance, in its efficacy <br />

in the following weeks <br />
I balanced fission and fusion in a quantum state <br />
and gave form to a perpetually renewable fuel source <br />

during the span of the trial by fire months <br />
I assembled each hand-crafted piece of the machine <br />
and coded the temporal equations into the AI <br /> 

in the final moments of that final year <br />
I sent my therapist a gold pocket watch <br />
then painted a fitting mantra onto the exterior frame <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>tempus edax rerum</em> <br />

*** <br />
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Rather than be less, </em> <br />
<em>Car’d not to be at all…</em> </p>

I stepped into the machine <br /> 
set to erase an excrescence from history <br />
no matter the consequence <br />

for who can escape <br />
the seduction of vengeance <br />
once it slithers past reason, past perspicuity <br />

*** <br />
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>The mind is its own place, and in it self</em> <br />
<em>Can make a Heav'n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n…</em> </p>

bullet, bladed pendulum, jawbone of an ass <br />
pillow, pike, vial of poison, pistol – <br />
what would you have used? <br />

my choice was efficient <br />
quick and painless – <br />
why would “age at time of death” matter? <br />

*** <br />
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power…</em> </p>

I returned to the present to await the timewave <br />
that would exact its cost and erase me <br />
but it never came <br />

it seems bio Grandma had a healthy appetite <br />
and was never at a loss for suitors <br />
or trysts behind the barn <br />

her son was born <br /> 
but five days after original bio dad was born <br />
with me still appearing 23 years (and change) later <br />

no worse for wear: <br />
two inches taller, brunette rather than blond <br />
and thanks to the Fates and Mendelian inheritance <br />

still <br /> 
gloriously <br />
on the spectrum <br />

and as for the young man whose last breath <br />
conceded eternity a lifetime ago <br /> 
in my arms <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>amor vincit omnia</em> <br />

*** <br />
<p style="text-align: right;"><em>The World was all before them, where to choose</em> <br />
<em>Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: </em> <br />
<em>They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, </em> <br />
<em>Through Eden took thir solitarie way. </em> <br /><br />
– John Milton, <em>Paradise Lost</em> </p>
