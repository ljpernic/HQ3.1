They named me Diana,<br />
they vilify me on their news reports, <br />
they say that I’m insane, a category five<br />
of wind and spinning rain, and they’re right<br />
to run away from my madness if that’s <br />
truly what it is, yeah, I’m a crazy bitch,<br />
if bitch means a slow accumulation,<br />
a fossilization of frustration, <br />
a dendrochronology of all the things<br />
built up over the years, the gathered tears<br /> 
and tree rings of the ostracized—<br />
I have receipts of all the times <br />
they ignored my warning signs,<br />
when my currents should have scared them,<br />
but they said I was a phase, a passing <br />
normal thing, and when they tried to ride <br />
their boat through me, I was not silent <br />
enough for their pleasure. Slurs tell on <br />
the ugliness of the speaker, yeah, they <br />
called me a slut for speaking up, for <br />
swirling too fast, for my glacier-fed <br />
waters swelling too high, and when<br /> 
they tried to pass through the center<br /> 
of my storm without an offering, well,<br />
I am a hurricane—a category five—<br />
I expect some form of drowning. <br />
