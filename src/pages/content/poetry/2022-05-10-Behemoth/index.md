Watch as I tend <br />
these ice-blue flames, <br />
poking and prodding <br />
every faltering gash. <br />
Lean in as I expatriate the spark<br />
and sizzle<br />
of kindred combatants. <br />
<br />
My hell-mouth <br />
reeks<br />
of animus. <br />
<br />
Distillation by fire, <br />
the hiss and whine<br />
of the Great Machine, <br />
its clunk and growl<br />
of rotors and gears—<br />
witness the mechanism<br />
that grinds me down<br />
deburrs every jagged seam<br />
*sucks out* <br />
every nib of defiance. <br />
<br />
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Bystander: <br />
Observe the process<br />
brooking<br />
infinitesimal measures<br />
of quality control<br />
&emsp;&emsp;there are no standards, no specifications<br />
<br />
yet it spits me out—<br />
<br />
*Go now. Figure out this life of yours.* <br />
<br />
—then damns me every time. <br />
