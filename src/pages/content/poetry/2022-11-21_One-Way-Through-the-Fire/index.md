It’s the first thing they tell you in Temporal Navigation 101: <br />

Time is water, <br />
But it knows no gentle ebb, <br />
Only the rage and riot of rapids. <br />
You can’t go back, the Temporists say; <br />
The currents are too strong. <br />
On this, the handbooks are agreed: don’t cling to lost time. <br />
Drift forward, travel on, but don’t fight the tide. <br />
Don’t be the fish caught in the hooks of days past, captive in its line. <br />
Keep all your lost loves tucked away like jewels to their boxes, <br />
Preserved in the dark velvet of memory. <br />
Leave regret on the sands of long-ago, <br />
As sailors do, bidding goodbye to the receding land. <br />
Time travel is a one-way trip. <br />

Once all the past you’ve left behind begins to pile up, <br />
You learn a new metaphor. <br />
Time is stone— <br />
You wear it down, pass through cracks, erode. <br />
You are the rapid; you, the gentle ebb. <br />
The handbooks got it wrong. <br />
You *can* go back, <br />
So long as you intend to stay, fixed as mountain rock, <br />
As the timestream loops around you. <br />
Two days, two months, a year— <br />
It depends on where you land. <br />
One golden point in time, forever silver on repeat, <br />
Like looping celluloid. <br />

Whichever fate you choose, you’ll come to realize this: <br />
Time is fire— <br />
It hurts to pass through, no matter which direction. <br />
