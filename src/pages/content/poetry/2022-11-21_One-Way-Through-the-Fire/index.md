title: One-Way, Through the Fire
author: Lin Darrow
issue: Issue Seven, November 2022
description: ''
shortdescription: 'It’s the first thing they tell you in Temporal Navigation 101: <br /><br />
Time is water, <br />
But it knows no gentle ebb, <br />
Only the rage and riot of rapids. <br />
You can’t go back, the Temporists say; <br />
The currents are too strong.<br />'
