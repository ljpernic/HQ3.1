And if you remember just one thing,<br />
Babe, remember this: there once were <br />
Corals here. Living things in vibrant hues beneath our waters, not these <br />
Dead husks fully slaughtered by the will of <br />
Ego-driven billionaires chasing profit over people,<br /> 
Fame over freedom to breathe, a <br />
Globe on fire over basic fucking decency.<br />
How, in this failed state, can I bear to share my own story? You see<br /> 
I tried, I did. We tried, we really did. It’s <br />
Just so goddamned hard to make a dent with <br />
Kings and kingmakers chasing glory,<br />
Leaving the rest scratching and scrabbling to have the slightest chance to<br /> 
Make our world from the ashes of the old. But after the burn, what’s left? <br />
Nobody told us we’d start with nothing but <br />
Overheated oceans and collapsing coastlines and <br />
Poverty-stricken people still yearning to breathe free (the not-so-huddled masses). We keep<br /> 
Questioning, keep fighting, keep banding together, keep <br />
Remembering what once was. And in this inevitable end: a blaze of glory; a whimper, not a bang; exit, pursed by bear; what is the point of <br />
Solidarity? Of standing up for something, of standing up for anything? In the end, it’s really for one last thing:<br /> 
To show them that it matters, that <em>we</em> matter, that this whole fucking world on fire matters. <br />
Unity won’t stop this out-of-control freight train—we’re on track for the <br />
Vilest ending—but the least we can do is show them that <br />
We’re here. <em>We’re still here</em>. At least, of course, until we’re not.<br /> 
X marks the spot: here lies Miami, here lies Venice, here lie the Maldives. There once were corals.<br /> 
You would have really loved the corals. Call me a <br />
Zealot, but don’t tell me to forget. There once was beauty here. Once, we lived.
