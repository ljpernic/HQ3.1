Inside extant skulls of extinct giants <br />
We’ve made our homes for many a summer <br />
Solstice. Wildflower wreaths, crowns, garlands <br />
Ornament the colorlessness of bone, <br />
Our way of giving thanks to the earth <br />
For not having annihilated our kind just yet. <br />
<br />
On solstice eve, ritual celebrations: <br />
Small children playing in the dark <br />
Under candles burning lambent along ribs <br />
Immense, planted in soil like monstrously mutated orchids. <br />
In their shade the children grow tall enough <br />
To touch sternums of sun-bleached white, <br />
Feeling the powder of non-existence rub <br />
Against their growing pains. <br />
<br />
For couples to wed, they must tie themselves <br />
To their colossus’ spinal column, <br />
Dangling like twin lungs all day long. <br />
If they hold onto each other, if the old bone <br />
Does not crumble, the red string doesn’t snap, <br />
Limbs remaining firmly in their sheaths, <br />
They shall be united evermore. <br />
If not, they shall vow to meet again in the next lifetime <br />
Whilst they crush as one to the unforgiving ground. <br />
<br />
We bed down in our giant’s vacant eye sockets. <br />
From the guts of night we watch the moon, its own hulking <br />
Skull from outer space. In the morrow we will greet <br />
The solstice with dances and feasts, a merry-go-round <br />
Of ribbons fanned from queerly fragile fingerbones. <br />
Goodnight, we say for now and blow out the candles <br />
Rendering our giant sightless with sleep. <br />
<br />
