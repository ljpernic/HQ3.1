<p style="text-align: center;">
is this how all things end? <br />
with a croak, a hiss, broken glass— <br />
some spilled wine, a sliver of blood <br />
and slime, trailing ever after. <br />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
tell me something else, then. <br />
where the frog never becomes a prince. <br />
that way she never marries a man <br />
whose kisses are a mossy damp, <br />
in whose breath she can smell algae <br />
and underwater dirt as he pulls her to bed, <br />
a sticky tongue across wet cheeks. <br />
where the princess' golden ball remains <br />
drowned in a green pond that yellow evening, <br />
and she learns a lesson or two <br />
about carelessness. <br />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
years later, <br />
and his eyes are still green <br />
as a choked pond, and her father, a skeleton <br />
barking orders at the back of her mind <br />
and her heart, a lamp <br />
sputtering for oil. <br />
oh, for promise is a ring <br />
she can never take off— <br />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<em>once upon a time</em>, <br />
the queen thinks, <br />
alone <br />
in her old starless garden, <br />
cups strewn among the weeds, <br />
wishing that she could have been <br />
something other than a bedtime lie <br />
and her prince anyone but a frog <br />
who croaks a love poem <br />
every now and then, <br />
swallowing flies. <br />
