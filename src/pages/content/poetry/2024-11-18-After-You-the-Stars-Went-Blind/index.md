chasm: i fall knee-deep into the shallows.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after you, the stars shut their eyes—<br />

the dark earth like algae flourished inside me.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my body: haystack in a farmhouse—<br />

a dark animal chewing away silently.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lilith: you who sings a thousand death songs—<br />

i haul the wind like an harp & it seizures my breath.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bleed: the moon peels its white into my mouth—<br />

the language inside me is a thick mollusc.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;blight: who knew a boy's hunger could swallow the dark?<br />

the thrush outside my window is mourning—<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i, an eclipse: inhabiting a shadow's hut.<br />

by dawn, rain begins to baptise the wreckage—<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an holy ghost: the lawn whitening like snow.<br />

by dusk: the darkening begins/ anew.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who knew a boy's dark could swallow the hunger?<br />
