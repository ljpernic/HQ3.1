While you are me, and I am almost you, <br />
I cannot help but think you spin me lies. <br />
I do not think that what we say is true. <br />

Your letter's from our future—and we rise <br />
to conquer bloody challenges ahead— <br />
though you are me, and I am almost you. <br />

I find it less than clear, sir, that we prize <br />
a similar result, from all you've said: <br />
I do not think that what we say is true. <br />

No—one's more apt to argue you despise <br />
the shadow of a past you thought was dead— <br />
because you're me, and I am almost you. <br />

If one of us will live, then I surmise <br />
your end is mine, someday. Am I misled? <br />
I do not think that what we say is true! <br />

I cannot show us mercy; the surprise <br />
of knives must sever both our threads… <br />
for you were me, but I’m becoming you. <br />
(I do not think that what we said was true.) <br />
