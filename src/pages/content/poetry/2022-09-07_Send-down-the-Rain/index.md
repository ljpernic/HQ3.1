zephyr sings a lullaby into my body <br />
that she may light my eyes and dulcify my tongue<br /> 

<em>don't listen to her—</em><br />
⁠the aphorism of my stomach roared in hurt<br />
and reluctantly, i was submerged in its words:<br />
that a lay cannot quench the lust for bread <br />
the lyrics to sweet melodies won't enchant <br />
food into my ears when my body perishes for lack<br />
of a real meal. <br />
how does the wind's music heal me?<br /> 
can she cast out the scars of drought's blade on my lips?<br />
how does the wind's music birth waters? <br />
waters—not the tears i drink, not the ichor that spills from my vulva.<br />
i search for memories of a once beautiful land <br />
but my eyes cleave to the art of stagnancy <br />
because dawn and dusk have lost the heavens’ downpour<br /> 
and even the rainmaker has begun to plead<br />
<em>send down the rain</em><br />
the moment hunger gobbled up his pride<br />
