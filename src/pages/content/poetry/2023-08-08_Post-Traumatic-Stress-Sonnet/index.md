Star-rise. I wake in arms of amber light, <br />
Awash in swiftly dreaming galaxies. <br />
I turn, I yawn, a wayward, drowsy sprite <br />
Untempered by dying vagaries. <br />
Wrap me instead in lazy gleam of quasar, <br />
In the shimmering dust of a thousand suns: <br />
come alive, Jong<sup>1</sup>, Pari<sup>2</sup>, Biduk<sup>3</sup>, Bintang Tujuh<sup>4</sup>. <br />
Come alive, as the glimmering tides become one <br />
Constellation; never lost, nor consumed <br />
But turned to iridescent astral flame. <br />
Resplendent in amaranthine hue, <br />
reveal to me at last heaven and all its names –  <br />

And liberate me from fear, mercurial hair still astray <br />
as forgotten starshine at last becomes dawning, never-ending day. <br />
