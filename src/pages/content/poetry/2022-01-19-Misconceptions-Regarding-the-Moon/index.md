The moon is a ghost, a god.<br />
She is a white rabbit of silver<br />
Eyes and whiskers.<br />
He is an ancient demon, a teething child.<br />
There is a person in the moon<br />
And they’re crying crater tears.<br />
<br />
To climb to the moon you must build<br />
A ladder of night-bleached bones.<br />
To launch yourself into lunar orbit<br />
You need only jump off the tallest cliff<br />
And the moon will catch you in its net.<br />
Shooting weapons at the moon in drunken revelry<br />
Is how the terrain is formed, the Sea<br />
Of Tranquility littered with shrapnel,<br />
The dark side, an arrow graveyard.<br />
If you swim in the ocean under argent light<br />
The moon’s elves will carry you<br />
Skyward in a sterling palanquin.<br />

Only few are privy to the truth.<br />
How one Day before the World<br />
Had finished building itself from Nothing,<br />
I found in the river made of my torrential grief<br />
A stone that only Days ago had weighed down<br />
The pockets of my lover’s dress; a stone<br />
Now infused with her last breath of bubbles.<br />
You see, her dainty, deity’s constitution<br />
Had been unable to bear the inexorable deluge<br />
Of Creation she and I started from our union,<br />
Choosing to give up her mortal body instead.<br />
<br />
I took the stone and rubbed it smooth and round<br />
Between my fingers, then dug my nails in,<br />
My teeth, clumsy scrivener<br />
Inscribing my billowy agony.<br />
I looked up with broken teeth and fractured<br />
Fingernails, and I was in the sky, celestial body<br />
Floating instead of falling, my touch of light<br />
Enfolding the whole infant World,<br />
My lover and I taking turns<br />
Holding and polishing our silver, scarred stone<br />
To a luminary sheen.<br />
