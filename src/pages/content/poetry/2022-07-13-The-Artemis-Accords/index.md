Like old kings come together <br />
in agreement of a contest <br />
so long as the princess-prize <br />
goes home with one of them. <br />
<br />
Now it is your turn <br />
for nations to fight <br />
over the pillaging of your body. <br />
<br />
The only questions remaining are: <br />
Who goes first? <br />
Who gets the best goods? <br />
<br />
Have women always been mines? <br />
<br />
Filled with precious gems, <br />
and it’s only a matter of time <br />
before they too are stripped <br />
—the only line of defence a cave in, <br />
<br />
or praying to you, <br />
way up there in the sky– <br />
for you to shine a moonbeam down <br />
and save them, make them <br />
<br />
of your coterie, your coven <br />
showing them tender encouragement <br />
and gentler hands than the astronauts <br />
who now reach up to you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<em>*The Artemis Accords, signed by the UK, USA, United Arab Emirates, Luxembourg, Japan, Italy, Canada, and Australia, set out the “Principles for cooperation in the civil exploration and use of the moon, Mars, comets, and asteroids for peaceful purposes”</em>
