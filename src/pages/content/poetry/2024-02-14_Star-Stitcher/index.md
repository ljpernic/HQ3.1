I sew behind time <br />
and feel too much <br />
in the dusty yard of the seamstresses’ house. <br />
Space fighters scream across the dark dome of sky overhead. <br />
The army needs tunics, so <br />
I wield my tiny sword. <br />
 
Blue and green lights flicker overhead, bright enough for me to see my work. <br />
I sense every thread. <br />
Old tomes say magic workers used to feel the threads of life, <br />
but those were ancient times. <br />
No one feels that now. <br />
  
When Mother Sellers’ hand rests heavy on my shoulder <br />
and she says she’s very sorry, <br />
I know my stitches were too slow to grant immunity. <br />

I don’t wait for dawn to walk out of the village. <br />
Constellations sparkle in the coldness of space. <br />
My feet crunch on frozen ground and <br />
my nostrils burn with smoke from the battlefield. <br />
 
I stumble upon a campfire’s embers where <br />
a woman with the enemy’s blue-dyed hair sits, <br />
knees drawn to chest, a bit of roasted meat in hand. <br />
She doesn’t draw a weapon, <br />
only a sardonic smile. <br />
 
A deserter like me. <br />

I creep forward and <br />
crouch at her fire. <br />
She hands me a strip of scorched flesh from a rodent she’s killed and <br />
tears meat from the bone with delicate teeth. <br />
She grabs my free hand, pulls it toward her. <br />
Traces the silvery lifeline. <br />
Tiny flesh-stars, linked by a thread. Her eyes are fierce in the firelight. <br />
<em>Star-stitcher. I sensed it</em>. <br />
 
But <br />
I’m a slow seamstress <br />
good only for cannon fodder … <br />
<em>or</em> <br />
the low pulse in my veins <em>could</em> be power. <br />

The far-off bow lights of fighters hover over the battlefield. <br />
Shells drop, staining the horizon red. <br />
She shivers, her shoulder and knee knocking mine. <br />
 
I pull out the needle, <br />
feel its miniscule weight, <br />
and let the internal threads uncurl along my veins. <br />

This sixth sense that made me a dull seamstress— <br />
this feel of every fiber and soul-link with every stitch— <br />
this is magic. <br />
 
I tilt my head back and <br />
drink in the constellations <br />
steadfast above the human strife. <br />
Mountain Lion crouches in the southwest. <br />
Barred Owl spreads her wings in the north. <br />
White-Tailed Deer stands at the center of the sky’s dome. <br />
 
Our sky gods, heartbroken at this battle. <br />
If I stitch them together, they can mourn as one. <br />
 
I hold the needle up to starlight <br />
The thrum of magic through my veins grows from a trickle to a flood <br />
The eyes of the woman at my side <br />
reflect skyfire. <br />
 
I hook the needle into starlight and draw threads through Deer’s hoof <br />
and connect them to Owl’s pinion <br />
and to Mountain Lion’s puissant jaw. <br />
The peaceful blanket of the night has <br />
stitches stronger than the battle. <br />

My heart slows. <br />
My magic strengthens. <br />
 
The constellation animals come together in the center of the sky, united. <br />
 
The sounds of falling bombs cease. No more red glow on the horizon. <br />
The space fighters’ blue and green lights sink lower <br />
until the ships are on the ground. <br />
 
Overhead, the constellations’ light pulses, <br />
clear, <br />
warm. <br />
 
I know how to wield my tiny sword. <br />
