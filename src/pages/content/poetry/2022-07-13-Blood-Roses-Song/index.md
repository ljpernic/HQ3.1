Roses without thorns, blooming and wet with dew. <br />
A garden of sweetness <br />
A song without bitterness <br />
A bird pouring out its heart at dawn <br />
Song pure and weightless in the trembling air. <br />
<br />
There were songs, there were birds, there was a forest. <br />
A tower that climbed into the sky. <br />
A girl trapped in the tower, leaning out, singing— <br />
She is singing, her long golden hair streaming down— <br />
Eyes closed. She is singing. <br />
<br />
We dreamed of flight, of soaring above the trees <br />
Of pouring forth our own songs <br />
Though our throats were choked with stones. <br />
<br />
<em>Fe fi fo fum.</em> <br />
Slow, heavy steps up the spiral stairs. <br />
A monster takes his axe. <br />
A girl shakes in her room as she hears her sister dragged off. <br />
Later, she’ll have to clean up the blood. <br />
<br />
Blood into bread, meat into pies, <br />
Bones cooked and cracked for marrow. <br />
Here are the bones he did not take <br />
The scraps, the gristle, the waste cast aside. <br />
She carries them up to the tower roof <br />
Spreads them out in the sun to dry <br />
For the birds to take. <br />
<br />
<em>Tell me a story</em>, the littlest one of us said. Wind blew against covered windows. <br />
We huddled and held each other tight. <br />
<em>Tell me a story.</em> <br />
<br />
We shook at a giant’s steps. <br />
We sang to ourselves, to each other, in the dark. <br />
Each night a new girl taken, devoured. <br />
Each day a new girl captured, brought to the tower. <br />
<br />
We sang of sunlight and home <br />
Of loved ones with faces far, far away. <br />
And when we could not bear the memories <br />
We made up new stories of new sunlit lands <br />
Sweet gardens without end <br />
Orchards of honeyed fruit <br />
A world without pain. <br />
<br />
Our living sister sweeps. <br />
She places a pot over the fire. <br />
She cleans and bakes and stirs <br />
Salt from her tears seasoning the meat. <br />
<br />
There is no softness here. <br />
No roses at the base of this tower. <br />
Only tangled thickets, dry and leafless <br />
Sharp with thorns. <br />
<br />
Birds come, a storm of wings <br />
Hundreds of them on the roof. <br />
Harsh caws and cries, but not only the crows <br />
The ravens and vultures and carrion birds <br />
Not only the curved-beak predators <br />
But also the humble and small <br />
Brown sparrow and wren, bright finch and <br />
The yellow oriole. <br />
Even hummingbirds like blurred jewels <br />
Come to sip at what blood remains <br />
To peck and swallow and tear <br />
To carry what they can in talons and beaks <br />
To consume what’s left <br />
To hold murdered bodies within their own <br />
To carry children away to the endless skies. <br />
<br />
She watches, the last of us. Waiting for her own turn. <br />
<br />
And we are in the sky, flying. <br />
And we are in the dark, telling stories. <br />
And we are at her window, singing <br />
Singing of escape. <br />
<br />
And there may be no prince on horseback, <br />
Though we fly throughout the lands seeking him, <br />
No noble brothers to break down the door <br />
No hero to storm the tower <br />
Even as we sing, we sing <br />
And the townspeople turn up their faces in wonder <br />
Hearing without understanding <br />
We sing, we sing <br />
We children with bird voices <br />
Scattering on all the winds of the world. <br />
<br />
We return for the next feast. For the next sister who joins us. <br />
And for the one who stays behind, who still lives. <br />
<br />
She waits, and we drop seeds past her window. <br />
We drip blood from our beaks. <br />
Where blood and seed mix, roses bloom amid thorns. <br />
We sing of endless roses and honey, of beauty entwined in barbs <br />
And our sister sings back. <br />
