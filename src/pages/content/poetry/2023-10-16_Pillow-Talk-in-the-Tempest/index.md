oh yes, I've seen the way you look at me <br />
through sea-glass dark as pits of mud-torn mire <br />
your heat-struck, jagged ditches lay desire <br />
too plainly, how you want to hear me scream <br />

white flash and glitter sprays across the sky <br />
below the glow of hungry, raging flame— <br />
if these are gifts to sway my heart to cries <br />
of awe and dumbstruck wonder at your name… <br />

there's blight in nitrous splits that must be forced <br />
I cannot tell you why your violence stings <br />
as we’re too old to know these blasted things <br />
except in feelings unexpressed and coarse <br />

you have my soul—why must you have <em>my</em> voice? <br />
if I want silence, silence is my choice <br />
