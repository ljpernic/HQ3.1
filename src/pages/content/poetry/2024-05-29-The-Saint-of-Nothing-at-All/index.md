I am a vertebra crowning <br />
Sevilla’s ghoulish horde. <br />
Ribs on a chandelier <br />
in Prague. Ten fingers <br />
twitching in ten churches. <br />

Yet I once received <br />
feverish promises, <br />
into ears the fish later ate, <br />
from a carpenter’s apprentice <br />
who showed me how <br />
skilfully he could mould <br />
a bead when his hand <br />
slipped under my shift. <br />
Long before pleas <br />
from pockmarked prayer-mongers, <br />
sweating into their wine. <br />

Stop it. I never <br />
shattered a wheel <br />
with my bare hands. Never <br />
wore foreskin <br />
to be married. My mother <br />
told me, <em>“Don’t <br />
turn heads and always <br />
say your prayers.”</em> <br />
And when I didn’t <br />
listen God made me <br />
a drowned girl, carrion <br />
for monks who stripped me <br />
down to my bare parts <br />
until I was worthy <br />
of reverence across Europe. <br />

And here you kneel <br />
before eyeless sockets <br />
that once housed <br />
socketless eyes, <br />
long since putrefied. <br />
Remember I <br />
also prayed before <br />
the end. Can’t you <br />
hear me weeping? Constantly <br />
seeking a face I might know <br />
in a country I don’t. <br />

Is my punishment for gaiety, <br />
for letting more than <br />
sacramental wine drip <br />
down my chin, <br />
to spend eternity watching <br />
pilgrims on their knees, kissing <br />
their rosaries until their lips <br />
bleed? Please, <br /> 

my name is Catherine. <br />
