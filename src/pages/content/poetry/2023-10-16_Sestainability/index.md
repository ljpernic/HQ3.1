The plasticsmith waits for the children to return <br />
with buckets full of scraps, bags, bottles, and toys <br />
meticulously scrapped and washed and clean. <br />
The buckets are weighed, then into the crucible they go, <br />
rendered down to grayish brown ingots, made ready <br />
for shipment from the Patch to the factories in the City. <br />

The children spend their gleaning time dreaming of the City, <br />
and the parents and brothers and sisters who might return <br />
after adventuring away for fortune and glory, getting ready <br />
to bring their families to them, with plenty of food and new toys. <br />
There are stories and songs to keep spirits high, how they will go <br />
to a place where everything is bright and dry and clean. <br />

You’d think things floating in the ocean would be clean, <br />
considering the amount of water, but it’s not like the City <br />
where the rain washes the pavement and automatic street sweepers go <br />
up and down the sidewalks, scrubbing dirt from every corner, to return <br />
the next night and do it all again. The cleaners, like toys <br />
running on tracks, poised and hungry, always ready, <br />

but constrained by the programming the City deems orderly and ready <br />
to tackle filth we   drop. There were trash cans to keep sidewalks clean, <br />
  but people are too busy, eager to get to the new toys, <br />
throwing gray-brown packaging aside. They crow to the City <br />
on social media about their purchases, then return <br />
their gadgets   to buy   the next, round and round and nowhere to go <br />

but to the Patch. The drifts and flotsam of trash will go <br />
floating out to sea, creating new islands, new worlds, ready <br />
for life to migrate and begin their harvest, to return <br />
the plastics newly molded, fresh and clean <br />
to the City, from the Patch, to the City, <br />
a whole ecosystem spawned by offcast toys. <br />

Tiny, sunburnt hands pick at the wheels of broken toys <br />
and halfheartedly push a dismembered   truck before letting it go <br />
to his bucket, barnacles covering its side like a city <br />
grown organic and efficient, naturally made ready <br />  
to filter the waters they float through, making clean <br />
the sea before being plucked, scrapped, not to return, <br />

to their purpose, but sacrificed for the City, cut adrift from the toys. <br />
Before long the gray-brown plastics return, and into the crucible they go, <br />
to feed the waiting appetites, ready and waiting for the bright, the new, the clean. <br />
