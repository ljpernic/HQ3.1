dot the j and cross the seven. <br />
upcoming in neon, in oppressive heat <br />
we dream with night-opened windows. <br />
too-small frogs can’t eat the mosquitos, <br />
preparing the party, the cake is neat <br />
but in this rotting mansion we’re still far from heaven. <br /> 
<br />
the kid still thinks cream cake is heaven— <br />
she wears a nightgown, only seven. <br />
awake from a dream, sees the kitchen neat, <br />
something rare in this dulling heat. <br />
where’d the adults go? like mosquitos, <br />
they disappeared out of open windows. <br />
<br />
in our stupor, far away from any windows, <br />
us partygoers think we’ve found heaven. <br />
in reality, we’re surrounded by mosquitos, <br />
but their buzzing sounds a band of seven. <br />
it’s not dancing weather with this heat, <br />
our dresses stained, no longer neat. <br />
<br />
the ragged swampland isn’t neat, <br />
but hidden within it are windows <br />
to a world of endless wine and heat <br />
where men and women find a heaven— <br />
the kid searches all night, but she’s only seven. <br />
all she sees are mosquitos. <br />
<br />
swarms and swarms, the delicate mosquitos <br />
suck our blood patiently, leave the wound neat <br />
with their tongues, we’d itch till seven <br />
but can’t see back to our entrance window, <br />
we cannot see out of our heaven. <br />
so let us dance, dance in the heat. <br />
<br />
the child, searching, melts in the heat. <br />
we succumb to the mosquitos. <br />
if we are to die, we die in heaven. <br /> 
the rotting house, it’s cream cake neat <br />
croaking frogs through broken windows. <br />
the kid is only seven. <br />
<br />
if we were mosquitos, we would see through the windows <br />
the heat would reveal itself as too true to be neat. <br />
she is only seven, too young for heaven. <br />
