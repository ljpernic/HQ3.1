<em>for Yemọja</em><br />

my mother keeps track of time by how much rain falls <br />
heavenwards. i know it is night because there’s a torrent <br /> 
& the grim reaper blades through the whirl. <em>it is night.</em> <br /> 
my mother stands at the threshold with a switchblade— <br /> 
no match for the reaper’s scythe <br /> 
but sharp & bold enough to  sl/ash every bubble <br /> 
of tiny deaths—wafting through the universe. <br />

i am twenty two years old—young & smart. <br />
i know how to hold my breath through the night— <br />
it is a rite—to save myself from the stench of death. <br />

we count the decades by the silence between each harvest <br /> 
of souls to the multiverse of blankness. <br />

in a dream where i slither into an alternate universe— <br />
a merboy with a face as mine begs me <br />
for something in a language i do not understand— <br />
he tries to explain to me in hieroglyphs <br />

& i place my mouth on one of the images—shaped <br />
like a scythe—only to wormhole into another dream <br /> 
within a dream within a dream within a blur. <br />

my mother keeps track of time by how much rain falls <br />
heavenwards. <em>it is morning.</em> the dews drift in light showers <br />
& there’s a song dripping from my mother’s mouth— <br />                          
sweet & sonorous—to make my body shake <br />
–free from the fogginess of fear & take a dip into nirvana. <br />



*Yemọja is a Yorùbá deity celebrated as the giver of life
and as the metaphysical mother of all orishas (deities) 
within the spiritual pantheon.
