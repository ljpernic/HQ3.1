The rain, sweet with the scent of summer, <br />
soaks the earth in its persistent falling from a woolly sky <br /> 
heavy with moisture imported from a place far away. <br />

Those who know tell us it will rain for days <br /> 
as the west burns in the unrelieved heat of the sun – <br /> 
all of this beyond our control thanks to the willingness <br />
of a handful to profit by whatever means possible. <br />

Those with the money hold the reins while we, <br /> 
the expendable fodder of greed, pay the price  <br />
for the wholesale destruction of our only home. <br />

Exhausted by the violence of nature we feed <br />
with violence against it, I wonder how long we can sustain <br />
what we call normal as the rape of the earth continues. <br />

If nothing changes the earth will die – plants, animals,  <br />
oceans and us – leaving only the stars to witness <br />
what the unprincipled, safe in their underground palaces, <br />
have wrought in the madness of greed. <br />

But, eventually, they too will die, and the universe <br /> 
will again – as it’s done so many times before – <br />
redesign the earth to ensure its existence. <br />
