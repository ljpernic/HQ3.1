We mooned our heart in orbit, <br />
illuminated our paths with orchids <br />
blooming in the dark, fertilized <br />
with the fate of our star. If the sun <br />
were the source of all life, our moon is <br />
its soul, a new world curled around the old, <br />
words of protection, a silver shine <br />
of direction. <br />

We tided our breath on our satellite, <br /> 
crescented our faces to the bright <br />
moonshine and took a step towards <br />
the shelter of our small lunar <br />
sentinel. Dag our legs in the sand, <br />
took our friends by the hand, and <br />
luciferined our future, made it glow <br />
from the inside out. <br />

We put our hopes to the endless night. <br />
Selened our thoughts, our dreams, <br />
our minds became an oxidized fall, <br />
the gleaming side of the dusk, our eyes <br />
lux, our bodies the beacon <br />
for the magnetic fields <br />
of change. <br />
