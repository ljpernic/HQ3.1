Molten air stifles, sea-thick <br />
and as sickening. Pocked stones <br />
become bowls I water with <br />
weighted limbs. Drained pith, dry bones <br />

in this park. All beyond thirst. <br />
You could drink first but your eyes <br />
are unseeing like they’re dried <br />
open. One more fried sunrise <br />

<em>(what rainforest?) </em> then drowning: <br />
leaded wings won’t let you fly <br />
when need floods you. You won’t eat, <br />
beak gaped at the heat-dome sky <br />

like a young crow pining for <br />
her mother. I am not her. <br />
Will you trust what I’ve brought when <br />
I am gone? Then drink water, <br />

<em>please</em>, in her name if not mine. <br />
More are in line for aid: squirrels <br />
reel, heat-drunk, trying to stand. <br />
Sun-muddled, the land now whirls <br />

to my eyes. None of you trust <br />
me. <em>It’s just me</em>. I can’t cool <br />
parched elders behind locked doors <br />
so let me pour you this pool. <br />

<em>(When the dome lifts and we hear</em> <br />
<em>the death list this year, please let</em> <br />
<em>no lives from this park be logged.) </em> <br />

Then fog: rain returns and yet— <br />
