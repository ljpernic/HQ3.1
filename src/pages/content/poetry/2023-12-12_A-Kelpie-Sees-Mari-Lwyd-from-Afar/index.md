‘Twas the night before Christmas and I froze in my pond <br />
When I heard a wassailing from the town close anon <br />
A dozen stout peasants with drink all aglow <br />
Were knocking on doors in the gentle-fall snow <br />

I spied you in their midst like an ancestor’s ghost <br />
Bedecked with bright garlands, the object of toasts <br />
With clapping of shoulders and patting of backs <br />
They stumbled on further, you leading the pack <br />

My cousin Unseelie, white spirit of winter <br />
Flanks shifting like snowdrifts and mane all a-kilter <br />
Gleaming dark eyes and bared teeth like a gash <br />
Surrounded by victims who welcome the gnash <br />

If <em>I</em> were to tread on the skirts of the town <br />
I’d be driven right out in a trice by that crowd <br />
What magic possess you to soothe peasants’ fear? <br />
And might you impart it, in the spirit of cheer? <br />

I’ve not eaten since autumn, the last summer’s breath <br />
My frogs are all sleeping, the reeds froze to death <br />
The thigh bones are broken and sucked of their marrow <br />
I’ve even broke into the neighboring barrows <br />

Now they’re all rapping the mayor’s front door <br />
To give you a crack at the crème de la poor <br />
This outrageous conduct I’ll no longer stand <br />
I must have a morsel; I’m joining your band! <br />

The mayor’s my dream feast all wrapped up in satin <br />
He swells on serf suffering, on taxes he fattens <br />
I won’t let you have him – or at least, may I share? <br />
You’re new in this county, it’d be too unfair! <br />

My hooves hit the road as he opens the door <br />
Without so much a smile for the caroling corps <br />
“Oh please, wait for me!” I neigh, sliding and slipping <br />
My hooves all iced over I can’t keep from tripping <br />

They all turn aghast as I plow through the fold <br />
To my hide they’d all stick if it weren’t for the cold <br />
“O delicate morsels, I’ll be back for you soon!” <br />
I fall on my rear as you all drop the tune <br />

Heedless of silence and all our distress <br />
Bearing the pudding comes mayor’s mistress <br />
The serving plate shatters, along with her scream <br />
As quick Mari Lwyd lunges inside to feed <br />

Chaos, what rapture! Pandemonium rules <br />
The peasants are fleeing sans torches, the fools <br />
While most gutter out in the arms of the frost <br />
One catches the straw of the good mayor’s croft <br />

I drag out the mayor, my teeth in his sleeve <br />
While you make a heel-turn, flames licking your wreaths <br />
What’s this? Those aren’t hoofprints! You’re clogging away! <br />
You’re no faerie ghost, you’re a mortal at play! <br />

I’m hurt, Fair Folk Faker, you’ve played me a fool <br />
I was planning to share him in my icy pool <br />
Invite you to dinner, then after, a show <br />
We could’ve had something – but we’ll never know! <br />

Well, it hardly matters, I’ve still got my meal <br />
I head for the cattails, ignoring his squeals <br />
And shout towards the town as I splash out of sight <br />
“Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!” <br />
