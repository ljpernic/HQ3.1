Through the blinds of my ground-level apartment <br />
I see the flash of red taillights; someone’s car <br />
backing into a parking space, sending forth a <br />
sudden claret flare like aliens landing in the night. <br />

Through the blinds, the blinding mid-morning sun <br />
burns my eyes as I startle to waking, some dream <br />
leaving me sweating and restless, wanting more <br />
of whatever it was that I cannot now remember. <br />

Through the blinds, in the yellow hour, late afternoon <br />
light falling like honey in a layered cascade <br /> 
painting dark and light stripes on my lover’s pale back <br />
like those on the bees, gilded fuzz to the touch. <br />

Through the blinds, the white light of the full moon <br />
reaches in to curl around my face, cupping it tender <br />
as a mother’s hand, singing her eternal siren’s song: <br />
*Come dance with me naked in the midnight hour*. <br />

Through the blinds, brilliant headlights cut into <br />
the darkness and I’m startled, become a white <br />
hind hunted through the forest by the fae, frantic <br />
to escape I flee, incandescent Wild Hunt prey. <br />

Through the blinds, the earliest light of day spills <br />
across the blanket in patterns like alien morse code; <br /> 
lying languid and half-awake between the worlds <br /> 
of evening and morning I try to translate the message. <br />

Through the blinds, the grey light of a foggy morn <br />
beckons to me to come out and get lost in the mist, <br />
stumble over the corpse of a traveler, pick up <br />
his abandoned pack and take up the adventure. <br />

Through the blinds, day and night dance an eternal waltz, <br /> 
bright to dim and sun to moon, weather and technology <br /> 
shaping their colors and endowing them with variety– <br />
every light a threshold, a pathway to somewhere else. <br />
