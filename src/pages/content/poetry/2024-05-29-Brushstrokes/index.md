The swirling colors of space and time <br />
float by the windows of the generation ship, <br />
a whole city—planet—galaxy unto itself <br />
soaring past aeons of stars <br />

Colors? 

Space is vast, black, and featureless, <br />
the ship a gray pinprick, pockmarked with cosmic dust, <br />
scarred with once-a-decade repairs, <br />
the black paint of its name scratched and faded <br />

Time is an abstract ticking of lightyears, <br />
a cycle of light and dark devoid of sun, <br />
of so-called years marked by clocks and arbitrary holidays <br />
to break up the gray monotony of nothingness <br />

Yet:

Orange swirls of joy surround a child chasing a ball down a corridor <br /> 
Classmates hold hands within yellow circles of friendship <br />
Love’s dotted red lines create an intricate, ever-changing lace <br />
while some wrap themselves in the green tatters of jealousy <br />

All eventually embrace the whiteness of death, <br />
for nothing lasts forever, not even this journey, <br />
though none will see its end, or the painting <br />
of which they are an integral brushstroke <br />
