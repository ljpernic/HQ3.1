We are crowded sisters<br />
with roots that tangle and quiver<br /> 
in the wind. Our roots cling <br />
onto brittle pieces of shattered, <br />
dried soil. Only crumbles hold <br />
our skeletal bodies upright. <br />
The leaves have long fallen, <br />
consumed by creatures <br />
who abandoned the forests <br />
and now barren grounds of Ascenkin. <br /> 
 
Our roots continued growing. <br />
Moss crawled up our scarred bodies, <br /> 
invading our cracks and creases, <br />
soaked up our sap. But we stand tall, <br />
our branches swaying <br />
not because of the wind. <br />
We create the wind. <br />
We have no eyes to see the world, <br />
but we can feel the rumble in our roots, <br />
the magic, the shouting voices echoing. <br />
We cannot echo back. <br />

Hands rest on us. Their joints crackling, <br />
like wispy roots under callused, webbed feet, <br />
bare, treading on leaves. Our fallen <br />
branches snapping. Both sound the same. <br />
Low whispers and murmurs whistle <br />
through mouths sitting ajar. Strange sounds <br />
unstopped by tongues escape through gaps <br />
that missing teeth leave free. They whisper <br />
into our hollows their plans for battle, <br />
but we cannot tell them that our roots <br />
sense the landmines waiting. <br />
They feel warmth by their campfires <br />
at night, but we feel fear. Fear <br />
that the flames will catch in the wind <br />
and drift towards our bodies, <br />
setting aflame our unbudding branches. <br /> 
 
Once they were children. Once <br />
we were sprouts.  Once <br />
they had cherubic naivete— <br />
a rare innocence in war. Once <br />
we were living trees. Once. <br />

Are trees supposed to bow? <br />
Branches supposed to droop?  <br />
Buds supposed to close and recede? <br />
What is grown, is it supposed to ungrow? <br /> 
 
We've been shot at. There are dents <br />
in our bark. Bare wounds stinging <br />
with the gentlest breeze. Vines crawl <br />
up our bodies, moss too, unwillingly, <br />
wrapping the wounds. Confining, <br />
constricting, like a cage, like armour. <br /> 
Protection? But perhaps not. <br />
 
They use us as shields <br />
because we are easier to use <br />
than one of their own. They die <br />
behind us. They die in front of us. <br />
They die never beside us. <br />
 
They do not care about our lives. <br />
But we are immortal, <br />
or were until they cut us down <br />
and made ships that were set to sail to escape <br />
elsewhere, to wreak terror upon new lands. <br />
 
We want life. Why do they only want death? <br />
We want life, and we will reclaim it, retrieve it. <br />
And we will return and rise, and rise, and rise— <br />
<br />
