Now, this is most important: Before the light in their eyes flicks off <br />
you must ignite the wick, set it near the head, be ready to reignite it in <br />
case breath or wind or rain snuffs out the flame. If you trip, the <br />
mortal’s thread will be at risk of seizure because the distance <br />

between our posts is thin as sin. This truth is absolute – there <br />
are always harvesters lingering in the dark, eager to swallow mishaps. This is <br />
why we count their beats, why we carry fire. For the unfortunate someone <br />
who wakens near the pitch-blackened shore, it’s a psychedelic-like <br />

experience: turning in circles without a compass and being drawn to a <br />
grove of trees, dropping apples red and green. Shaded, the pretend signalman <br />
doesn’t appear threatening. Its humble rags hide hungry innards, while the swinging <br />
basket cradles a soul-stained axe and chains. The lost don’t get a <br />

second chance; they’re reckoned bound forever. Thus, the wick – the lantern. <br />
