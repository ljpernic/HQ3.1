They slink in, hats drawn <br />
low against their faces.  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I hear  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you find things out. I hear  <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you're willing to do things <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for cold hard cash. I hear <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you know something of poisons. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of death. <br />
You got cash?</em> <br />
Sometimes they spill a golden coin or two, <br />
or seven tarnished silver coins. Or a shirt <br />
woven from nettles. Can turn you from a bird, <br />
they say. Or maybe the other way around. A <br />
golden ring that never fits. Boots with <br />
iron soles. A shard from a shattered slipper. <br />
<em>So, what's a royal like you</em> <br />
<em>doing in a place like this.</em> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I gotta problem.</em> <br />
Of course you do. I'd add <em>sweetheart</em>, <br />
but there's nothing sweet about them. <br />
Even if –  <br />
<em>And is that a sword, or</em> <br />
<em>you just happy to see me.</em> <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I can't be happy. Not until –</em> <br /> 
it ain't the usual case, and yet, it is <br />
always the same. Every time. They want <br />
the <em>why</em>. Why the tower. Why the apple. <br />
Why the slipper always breaks. <br />
Why hate spirals around their skin. <br />
What they did to deserve this.  <br />
Me, I got no answers. It ain't my thing. <br />
I'm no fairy godmother, no <br />
youngest prince. I'll hunt around, <br />
I tell them, maybe even <br />
dust for fingerprints. Find out <br />
who's behind this. Maybe. I don't <br />
always get the right one. I take <br />
the dresses brilliant as the sun and moon, <br />
the sword that won't shut up. <br />
Maybe I'll sell them somewhere. Meantime, <br />
they should see the city. Top to bottom. <br />
Mostly bottom. Let the streetlights <br />
guard their skins. It ain't <br />
happy ever after, no. It's fog. <br />
It's rain. It's snow, soaking <br />
through their skin. But  <br />
safer than some damn fairy tale. I stay <br />
in my chair when they slink away. <br />
My floor's already stained with blood. <br />
