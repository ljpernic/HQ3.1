  bio: TJ Price’s corporeal being (he/him) is currently located in Brooklyn, NY, with his handsome partner of many years, but his ghosts live in northeastern Connecticut 
    and southern Maine. He either is or has been a wine-seller, a wine-drinker, an avid reader, an obsessive writer, a pen-and-ink artist, a dishwasher, a 
    neurosurgical technologist, a proofreader, a storm-watcher, a music-maker, and other sundry avocations. <p>Primarily, TJ spends his time reading as much as his 
    eyes can take, but when he's not reading, he's either writing weird stories about unnerving things, drawing lots of little circles in pen and ink, enjoying esoteric 
    studies, or taking photographs of clouds.</p>
