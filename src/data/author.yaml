  urged women not to wear them because of their harmful effects on vital organs.[2] She described herself as 
  'a bulldog running along at the feet of Jesus, barking at what He doesn't like',[3] and claimed a divine 
  ordination to promote temperance by destroying bars.[4]"

  records say 'Carrie', which Nation used for most of her life; the name 'Carry' was used by her father in 
  the family Bible. Upon beginning her campaign against liquor in the early 20th century, she adopted the name 
  Carry A. Nation, saying it meant 'Carry A Nation for Prohibition'.[5] After gaining her notoriety, 
  Carrie officially registered 'Carry' as a trademark.[6]"
