  teaserText: Issue One is finally here! Pick up a copy to reading stunning tales of mayhem and merriment, from a jewelry heist gone wrong in Dawn Vogel's "The Shell Game" to 
      the front lines of the howler war with João F. Silva in "The Cavalry." If poetry is more your speed, listen when the trees speak in "Ascenkin's Roots" by Ai Jiang and 
      follow the wolves in Thomas Zimmerman's "Wolf Rune" to hear their song too. 
      

      We have wonderful fiction by Gabrielle Johansen and Annika Barranti Klein already available to read on our website, and the rest of the issue will go up on December 7th. 
      But if you just can't wait to dive into A.T. Sayre's Weird-with-a-capital-W story "The Spot" about a man whose stomach begins to glow or Brian Hugenbruch's sonnet 
      "The Opposite of Time," which takes us into the tempered void and beyond, then feel free to snag a copy through patreon or ko-fi!

  teaserText: Haven Spec is a brand new online magazine publishing science fiction and fantasy stories and poems for the 21st century. We publish six issues a year, and 
      we welcome diverse voices from around the world. Two of our issues will be focused on the climate crisis (see our guidelines for more!), and otherwise our issues will 
      run the gamut of the SFF and weird spectra.  
      

      So grab a copy of Issue Zero (it's free!) and discover tales of magic powers passed down through the generations in "The Putnam Tradition" by Sonya Dorman, or what happens 
      when pyramid schemes get out of hand in "The Snowball Effect" by Katherine MacLean! If poetry is more your speed, then check out "The Frozen Ocean" by Viola Meynell, 
      in which the wide ocean takes a page from Bartleby the Scrivener, crosses its arms, and tells the world <em>I would prefer not to.</em>

  artistbio: Albert Robida (14 May 1848 – 11 October 1926) was a French illustrator, caricaturist, and novelist. His science fiction trilogy explored what life would be like 
            in the distant future of 1955, where we'd be flying around in tubes high above the city and spending all our free time watching TV on our <em>Téléphonoscope</em>. He was 
            half right.
            
            
            This cover is part of a larger work called "Paris at Night," in which the people of Paris are flying through the sky on metal ships shaped like fish, and we ask 
            ourselves how we ended up in the wrong timeline. The image was first publish in Paris in 1883 and is in the public domain.
