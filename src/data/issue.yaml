  teaserText: Haven Spec is a brand new online magazine publishing science fiction and fantasy stories and poems for the 21st century. We publish six issues a year, and 
      we welcome diverse voices from around the world. Two of our issues will be focused on the climate crisis (see our guidelines for more!), and otherwise our issues will 
      run the gamut of the SFF and weird spectra.  
      

      Issue One will be released in November and it'll have all the wonderful prose and poetry we've managed to pluck from our submissions queue, but for Issue Zero, we've 
      scoured the internet looking for the best of what the public domain has to offer. We've included these stories and poems to give you a sense of the kinds of things we're 
      looking for, but it is by no means exhaustive.


      So grab a copy of Issue Zero (it's free!) and discover tales of magic powers passed down through the generations in "The Putnam Tradition" by Sonya Dorman, or what happens 
      when pyramid schemes get out of hand in "The Snowball Effect" by Katherine MacLean! If poetry is more your speed, then check out "The Frozen Ocean" by Viola Meynell, 
      in which the wide ocean takes a page from Bartleby the Scrivener, crosses its arms, and tells the world <em>I would prefer not to.</em>

      We've included stories and poetry from such literary giants as Edna St. Vincent Millay, William Butler Yeats, Ray Bradbury, and Mary Shelley, but if you're in the 
      mood to try something new (or at least new to you!), discover a new favorite writer from the early 20th century in T.D. Hamm, Miriam Allen deFord, or Alfred Noyes!

  artistbio: Albert Robida (14 May 1848 – 11 October 1926) was a French illustrator, caricaturist, and novelist. His science fiction trilogy explored what life would be like 
            in the distant future of 1955, where we'd be flying around in tubes high above the city and spending all our free time watching TV on our <em>Téléphonoscope</em>. He was 
            half right.
            
            
            This cover is part of a larger work called "Paris at Night," in which the people of Paris are flying through the sky on metal ships shaped like fish, and we ask 
            ourselves how we ended up in the wrong timeline. The image was first publish in Paris in 1883 and is in the public domain.
