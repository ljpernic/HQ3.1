  teaserText: These poems and fictions, like my life at the moment, are about change. Resisting it. Surrendering to it. Massaging it and its outcomes.


    IV One is about getting revenge for other versions of you because you couldn’t get revenge for yourself. One is about the specter of 
    grief and the art of letting go. One is about listening to the world we found amid the buzz of the world we’ve made. One is about 
    becoming an alien and falling in/out/in love. One is about the powers of love, admiration, and becoming. One is about being taken and
    choosing to stay. One is about the travaux a woman survives and who she’s meant to be afterward. One is a force of nature and/or a 
    woman scorned. One is sci-fi synesthesia. One is about the journey, what you lose to embark and what you find along the way. 


    In this issue, you will find fiction by Madi Haab, N. R. M. Roshak, Rin Willis, Avra Margariti, Natalia Theodoridou, and Matt Tighe, 
    poetry by Emmie Christie, Jess Gofton, Elizabeth Shack, and Sofia Ezdina, and short fiction reviews by Danai Christopoulou. 
    The cover art is by Lauren Raye Snow.

  teaserText: Spring has come to the Northern Hemisphere, and that means the birds are singing, the plants are blooming, and there's more 
    great fiction and poetry to read! Spring is a time of renewal, a time of opening back up after the claustrophobia of winter, but it's not 
    all sunshine and puppy dogs. A spectre is haunting us, like Marx and Engels said, but instead of communism, it's the deep and 
    abiding dread of the climate crisis knocking on our doors. The March issue therefore is a special one, what we call our DRY ISSUE, and it's 
    full of stories and poems meant to evoke a vision of a changing world, an clarion call of catastrophe and hope. Here are the sins of our past 
    and the bright songs of a painful and glorious future. 


    In this issue, you will find fiction by E.M. Linden, Ai Jiang, Crystal Lynn Hilbert, and Lucero Valdovinos, poetry by Temidayo Okun, 
    Abdulkareem Abdulkareem, and P. H. Low, and short fiction reviews by Danai Christopoulou. Cover art is by Aimee Cozza.

  teaserText: This issue came together around concerns of the personal and the domestic, from the found family and magic of the truth 
    in "The Calligrapher's Granddaughter" by Stewart C Baker to the physical toll of grief and loss in pieces like Elise Stephens's "Focal 
    Point" and Jelena Dunato's "Heart of My Heart, Soul of My Soul." For something more capital-W Weird/body horror-y, we also have "Axolotol" by Atreyee Gupta, 
    about body doubles and never feeling like you're enough, and Rebecca Angelo's "Resistant," in which Clark has a very bad day at the hands of the 
    mind-source.


    For poetry, you might consider the bleak wonder of Nnadi Samuel's "A Wreckful Planting of Small Pockets of Thirst" and Julie Allyn Johnson's "Behemoth," stare at 
    the lights through your first floor apartment in Melissa Ridley Elmes's "Every Light a Threshold," or sink into the roots of pieces like "Tall Tales" by F. J. 
    Bergmann and "Unearthen" by Carly Racklin aand cover yourself over with soil.

  artistbio: Savanna Judd is an illustrator who loves drawing gooey shapes. They blend art with code, paint and paper with digital tools, and illustration with motion. 
    In painting scenes, they seek to bend light, build atmosphere, and capture the liminal quality of a place alive in the absence of people. These places represent a 
    threshold where humans pass and leave imprints or relics. They evoke the feeling of looking into a portal before entering.

  teaserText: Issue Three is now available! This is our very first DRY ISSUE, bringing you all the latest and greatest fiction and poetry dealing with the hotter aspects of 
      the climate crisis. In stories like "Sworn Guardian" by Kimberly Christensen and "Hope&#58 A Perspective from the Forest" by Tadayoshi Kohno, you'll find the 
      ravages of fire burning through the forests and all the ways the creatures of this world, human and otherwise, fight back.
     

      You might also pull up a chair at the Cambridge University archives on the hottest day in July in Meghan Kemp-Gee's "The End of the World," or consider exploring 
      what happens when the water at last runs out and all we have left is our thirst in stories like "For the Remnants" by Belicia Rhea and "Chrysanthemum" by Erin Keating. 
      
      
      For poetry, you can dive into a world of mosquitos and fever dreams in "sestina for the summer solstice" by Claire McNerney, watch as the nymphs hightail it as the 
      world around them withers and burns in "The Nymphs Are Migrating" by Madalena Daleziou, or stare into the void the Earth's become, "an embarrassing mess that no // 
      one // wants to clean // up" in Marisca Pichette's "And it dries and dries."

  artistbio: Albert Robida (14 May 1848 – 11 October 1926) was a French illustrator, caricaturist, and novelist. His science fiction trilogy explored what life would be like 
            in the distant future of 1955, where we'd be flying around in tubes high above the city and spending all our free time watching TV on our <em>Téléphonoscope</em>. He was 
            half right.
            
            
            This cover is part of a larger work called "Paris at Night," in which the people of Paris are flying through the sky on metal ships shaped like fish, and we ask 
            ourselves how we ended up in the wrong timeline. The image was first publish in Paris in 1883 and is in the public domain.
